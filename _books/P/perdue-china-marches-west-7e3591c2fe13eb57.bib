      This introduction to the modern era from a political and ecological perspective tells of the decline of the region’s last nomadic empire, the Zungars, at the hands of the Russians and Chinese in the 18th century. The decline of the Zungars was a “world event” that closed a last frontier and paved the way for competition between two great empires.
