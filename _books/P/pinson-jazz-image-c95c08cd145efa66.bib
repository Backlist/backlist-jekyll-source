      Pinson’s book on Leonard’s iconic photography from the 1940s and 1950s—think of a black and white Dexter Gordon, sitting with his saxophone in hand, surrounded by thick wisps of cigarette smoke—is an excellent reminder that jazz is more than just an acoustic phenomenon. An attempt to grapple with why the music of these immediate postwar decades has come to define the contemporary jazz mainstream, her work argues that these images have cemented a popular, past-oriented expectation of how jazz should sound.
