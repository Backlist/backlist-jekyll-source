      By 1900, Germany featured some of the largest and best-known ethnography museums in the world, but they were nearly bursting at the seams, overflowing with a confused mish-mash of cultural objects. This problem caused many leading museum thinkers in Germany to focus on a more nuanced style of empiricism, devoted to creating a science of human culture and history. Penny reminds us that museums are influenced by a variety of factors beyond intellectual influences alone—market forces, collecting realities, and demands made by both local patrons and visitors work to change the dynamic over time. The desire to “salvage” the material culture of supposedly vanishing cultures deeply influenced German anthropologists, engaging in a frenzy of gathering while limited by unwritten rules of what were acceptable collecting practices.
