      This vast cultural history of the U.S.-Cuban relationship explores the unique ties that developed between the two countries in the hundred years preceding the Cuban Revolution. The book shows how everyday encounters with the United States and its people, sports, entertainment industry, markets, and values shaped Cubans’ varied understandings of their own national identity.
