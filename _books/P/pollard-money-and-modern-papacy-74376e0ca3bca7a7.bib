      Anyone who has watched <i>The Godfather Part III</i>, or read about recent Vatican scandals, knows that the Holy See’s financial dealings are wide, complex, and anything but transparent. Based on a wide array of sources, and especially the diary of Bernardino Nogara, Pope Pius XI’s financial advisor, this excellent monograph explains how the Vatican’s economy evolved after the loss of the Papal States, as it forced the popes to rely, first, on contributions from the faithful throughout the world, and second, on the income from all kinds of investments and bank operations. For the author, this dramatic transformation in the Vatican’s finances helps explain the successful processes of church expansion and centralization after 1870, as well as the peculiar path of reconciliation with Italy in the 1920s.
