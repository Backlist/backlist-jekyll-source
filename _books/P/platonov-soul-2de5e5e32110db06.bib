      Platonov’s little novel is an ambivalent vision of Communism set in the Turkmen desert: a native son of the fictional _dzhan_ people returns home from Moscow to save them from a fate of wandering poverty and discovers they have no desire to be saved. This haunting work of fiction is also a sort of Soviet traveler’s account, as Platonov conceived of it while on a Soviet writers’ brigade to Turkmenistan in 1933, though it was only published posthumously. It will leave you gasping.
