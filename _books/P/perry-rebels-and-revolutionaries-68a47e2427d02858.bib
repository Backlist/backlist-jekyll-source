      An accessibly written though theoretically sophisticated work that focuses on similarities and differences between insurrections. The first major publication by a political scientist so historically minded that she later won an American Historical Association book prize, it introduces readers to a colorful cast of participants in violent actions, from militiamen (concerned only with protecting their villages) to bandits (inspired by Robin Hood-like tales), to Communist organizers.
