      Since at least the middle of the twentieth century, science has been the dominant human activity taking place on the Antarctic continent.  _Ice, Water, Stone_ offers one of the most engagingly written descriptions of the nature of scientific work in this part of the world.  The book focuses on Greenâ€™s experiences as a geochemist investigating the ice-covered lakes in the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, and provides a real sense of how scientists can become so attracted to working in the extreme environments of the southern continent.
