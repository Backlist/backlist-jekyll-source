      Together with its sequel, [_Visions of Freedom_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/1469628325/ref=nosim/clionautics-20), this book tells the epic tale of Cuban, U.S., and (to a lesser extent) Soviet struggles over the fate of Africa. Gleijeses was the first historian allowed access to classified Cuban archives, and he uses them to great effect to uncover the surprising roles that the tiny Caribbean island played in Africaâ€™s decolonization and postcolonial struggles.
