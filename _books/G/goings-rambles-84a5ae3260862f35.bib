      Only the people who survived American slavery could truly understand the experience of enslavement, and the power of their stories were vital to the ultimate success of the abolitionist movement. Born in Virginia, Goings saw nearly every part of the United States east of the Mississippi before finally escaping to Canada. Critics blasted slavery as backward and stagnant, but Goingsâ€™ epic journey demonstrates that in truth it was a system in near-constant motion.
