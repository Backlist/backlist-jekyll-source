      As global head of the Catholic Church, one of the Vatican’s main tasks consists in securing adequate conditions for religious practice in each of the states where the Catholic faith is present. In doing so, the Vatican has inevitably been wrapped up in larger domestic and geopolitical tensions, and so has had to refine an extremely sophisticated way of dealing with worldly powers. After more than half century of its publication, this classic work is still the best guide in English for understanding how the instruments, practices, and priorities of papal diplomacy have evolved over the centuries. If you want to know what a “nuncio” does, why the Secretary of State is so important, or what a “concordat” implies, this is the book to find.
