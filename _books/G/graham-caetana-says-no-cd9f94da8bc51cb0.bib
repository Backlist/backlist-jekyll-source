      This fascinating book explores two crucial moments in the lives of two women from very different backgrounds in nineteenth-century Brazil— each one centered around a key primary document of their struggles. The first, Caetana, is a slave who seeks the annulment of a marriage forced upon her by her master. The second, Dona Inácia, is from a wealthy planter family and uses her will and testament to free the family of one of her favorite slaves. The book is an enlightening journey through these lives, showing us once again that there is more than meets the eye when it comes to understanding Brazilian society.
