      Considering its cultural and political importance as a driver of drug violence on the US-Mexico border, the history of cocaine was strangely impoverished before Gootenberg got his hands on it. This is by far the best global history of that numbing and highly addictive drug, which emerged out of a very different context of medical and ritual use of coca leaves in the Andean world.
