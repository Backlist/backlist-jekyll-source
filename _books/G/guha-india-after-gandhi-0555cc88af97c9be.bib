      _India After Gandhi_ is a comprehensive history of India’s commitment to secular, liberal, and democratic values since 1947 when India became independent of British colonial rule.  This well-written and engaging volume explains how India has persistently met the challenges it has faced, both from within and outside its borders.  At once considered “modern,” because of its scientific and technological prowess, the making of modern India and Indians has been tested by secessionist and minority movements as well as by so-called “traditional” practices involving religion, gender, caste, and ethnicity.
