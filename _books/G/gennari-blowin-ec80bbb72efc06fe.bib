    text: >
      A book about writing about music, this history of jazz criticism is crucial to understanding the deeply intertwined relationships between making and listening to jazz and the texts published about them. It is an essential read for thinking about the role that the conceptualization and historicization of jazz have played in what musicians play (and how they present it) and how fans and the record industry have heard it.
