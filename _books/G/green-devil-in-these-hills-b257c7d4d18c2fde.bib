      Even in popular narratives of the American freedom struggle, the experiences of workers are downplayed. Green demands that we center workers in this story. His tale of how West Virginia coal miners fought against oppression and murder by their bosses for decades, eventually led to the 1921 Battle of Blair Mountain, the largest domestic insurrection since the Civil War. This book will force you to rethink the American story of freedom.
