      There is something endearing about the Renaissance polymath Girolamo Cardano. Born in 1501, Cardano was a best-selling author, a mathematician, an astrologer, and a physician—and that is by no means an exhaustive list. A firm believer in the venerable great chain of being, Cardano was nevertheless a thoroughly early modern man. Quick to exploit the new medium of print to his own advantage, one cannot help but think Cardano, if alive today, would be heavenly invested in dotcom startups. Though Cardano is one of the few early modern figures whose [diary is available in paperback](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/1590170164/ref=nosim/backlist0e-20), it is more illuminating (not to mention more fun) to get to know this extraordinary figure of the Scientific Revolution through Grafton’s sensitive, witty intellectual biography.
