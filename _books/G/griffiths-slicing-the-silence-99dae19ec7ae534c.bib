      Griffiths is an Australian environmental historian, and he visited Antarctica with the Australian Antarctica Division.  Part history, part travelogue, _Slicing the Silence_ offers a beautifully written account of daily life in contemporary Antarctica alongside a discussion of how we came to be where we are today.  The book is particularly effective in showing the strength of national attachment that countries such as Australia feel for Antarctica.
