      Most of us have heard of Copernicus, and know that sometime during the Scientific Revolution he turned the heavens inside out, placing the sun in the center and setting the earth into movement around it. It was a counter-intuitive—some would say crazy—claim, and one that made remarkably slow progress when it came to upsetting the prevailing geocentric worldview of the early modern period. Gingerich set out to discover why it took so long for Copernicus’s theory to gain followers by tracking down every annotated copy of the Polish astronomer’s revolutionary work in libraries and bookshops across the world. His findings overturned much of what we thought we knew about the contemporary, lukewarm reception of Copernicus’s ideas. Adventure story and book mystery in equal parts, _The Book Nobody Read_ is the perfect follow up to Lovejoy’s _The Great Chain of Being_.
