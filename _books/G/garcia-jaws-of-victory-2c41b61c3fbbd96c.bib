      Cesar Chavez is an icon. But mythology helps no one understand the past. Before 2010, books about the United Farm Workers took a hagiographic tone toward Chavez. That’s a mistake. Garcia’s book is the best of the new examinations of the UFW. Chavez was a deeply flawed union leader who actually damaged his union’s long-term chances at success.
