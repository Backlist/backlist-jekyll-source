      This book delves into an amazing period of Amazonian history, when the rain forest very suddenly became an important resource for the Allies to win World War II. The government of Brazil under populist dictator Getúlio Vargas had already been trying to economically revitalize and integrate the region. The outbreak of war in the Pacific, and the loss of Malaysian rubber supplies, made Amazonian rubber crucial for the Allied war effort, and in partnership with the Americans, the Brazilian government recruited tens of thousands of “rubber soldiers” – poor workers from drought stricken regions – to move to the Amazon and tap rubber for the war effort. Garfield’s careful study of rubber tappers and the geopolitics of world war provides a new foundation for the recent environmental history of the region.
