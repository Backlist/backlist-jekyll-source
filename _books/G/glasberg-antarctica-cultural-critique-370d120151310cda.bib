      Glasberg visited Antarctica as part of the US National Science Foundation’s “Artists and Writers” program, but her book is scathing about ongoing links between science and imperialism.  She demonstrates that far from being a benign “continent for peace and science” contemporary Antarctica has strong connections to the military-industrial complex and US expansionism.  Glasberg’s interpretation of Antarctic history focuses on gender politics, and she offers a wonderful analysis of Ursula Le Guin’s short story _Sur_, about a group of South American women who became the first people to reach the South Pole but decided not to tell anyone about their experiences.
