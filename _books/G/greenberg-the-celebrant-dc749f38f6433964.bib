      _The Celebrant_ is not among the best-known novels to emerge from the intersection of baseball and literary fiction over the past century, but it is beloved by baseball scholars and writers. Greenberg imagines the relationships between three Jewish immigrant brothers and Christy Mathewson, the New York Giants pitcher who was the first universally admired major league star and an icon of Protestant culture. Greenberg explores the nature of baseball fandom while meticulously chronicling the details of early twentieth-century ballgames, and brings those two strands together in the novel’s culminating event: the 1919 World Series tainted by allegations of game fixing against eight Chicago players known as the “Black Sox.”
