      Although the environmental historian Richard Grove is concerned with ecological change on tropical islands rather than drugs per se, his book is an essential read for anyone interested in the larger environmental contexts of the drug trade. In particular, Grove argues that French and British attempts to establish monocultures of valuable spices and drugs on tropical islands in the eighteenth century led to some of the earliest scientific observations of species loss and ecological damage due to human actions.
