      Written by a founding member of the Subaltern Studies Collective, this book is a classic text that challenges the long held perception that Indians passively accepted British rule.  Guha argues that Indians were constantly resisting and subverting British colonial rule during the two hundred years of British occupation (roughly from 1765-1947).  My two favorite chapters focus on rumor and what Guha calls the “prose of counterinsurgency.”  By asking how rumors become believable, Guha shows that rumors explain how non-elites held a deep distrust of their rulers, and how particular suspicions were invoked in moments of crisis.  By thinking about how we write about crimes, whether petty theft or drunkenness, Guha challenges us to imagine how peasants, workers, and untouchables resorted to public disorder to disrupt “normal” society.
