      This edited volume bears witness to a little-known fact of the Revolutionary War: French-speaking Canadian colonists played a key role in one of the Continental Army’s first major military offensives of the American Revolutionary War. For various reasons, both voluntary and involuntary, Canadian colonists helped bring about the Continental Army’s first successes in its Canadian Campaign of 1775-1776, and Quebec during the American Invasion provides a lens into some of their actions. Although the edited source base reflects the point of view of imperial agents in support of Quebec’s British colonial government, Gabriel’s edited volume provides a crucial window into a largely illiterate peasant agrarian populace. These sources complicate our understanding of happenings in British Canada and elsewhere in North America during the Revolutionary War.
