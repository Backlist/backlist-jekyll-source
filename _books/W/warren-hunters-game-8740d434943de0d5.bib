      In _The Hunter’s Game_, Warren focuses on the idea of public land as a kind of national commons. He looks at a series of cases to explore the ways conservation management shaped (and often limited) access to natural resources for local users. In his first example, Warren draws on the story of a Pennsylvania game warden’s murder to make visible how conservation policy (something we tend to accept as “good”) was wielded to do some particularly ugly things. Warren’s engaging cases push us to think about which uses—and which users—win and lose under a range of conservation frameworks.
