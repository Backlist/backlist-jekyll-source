      What, you might ask, is the relationship between a German astrologer-alchemist of the sixteenth century and an English mathematician of the seventeenth century? The answer, it turns out, is magic. Webster, in this compact and elegant book, counters the common misperception that the Scientific Revolution depended upon a sloughing off of magic and other “superstitious” medieval habits of mind.  The juxtaposition of these two figures, Paracelsus and Newton, provides telling insights into the unpredictable ways that scientific thought develops.
