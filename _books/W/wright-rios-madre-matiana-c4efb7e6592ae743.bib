      Writing popular religious history is hard work, not least of all because sources that speak to the beliefs and practices of ordinary people are often maddeningly scarce, and intriguing archival glimpses often lead to cold trails. In researching his excellent first book, _Revolutions in Mexican Catholicism: Reform and Revelation in Oaxaca, 1887-1934_ (2009) Edward Wright-Ríos stumbled upon a story that he successfully followed down the historical rabbit hole: that of a late-colonial mystic known as La Madre Matiana whose prophecies of doom captivated Catholic pamphleteers during Mexico’s secularization conflicts of the nineteenth century and who became an archetype of female “fanaticism” in the hands of liberal newspaper editors during the Revolution. This fascinating book turns to interpretation and rigorous contextualization where the historical evidence of Matiana falters, showing that although the prophetess herself was probably apocryphal, she influenced public debates about modernity, gender, and nationhood well into the twentieth century.
