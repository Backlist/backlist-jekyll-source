      As good a place to begin as it was when I was assigned it in the late 1970s, this book surveys major events from the 1644 start of rule by the ethnically Manchu Qing Dynasty through the 1911 Revolution that established the Republic of China. It includes wonderfully straightforward chapters devoted to key social classes and a particularly lively account of the Taiping Uprising, a failed millenarian insurrection led by a man who claimed to be Christâ€™s younger brother.
