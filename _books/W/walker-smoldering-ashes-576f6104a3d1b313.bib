      Revising our understanding of Peruvian history between 1780 and 1840, Walker explores how Andean political culture evolved from the violent and utopian beginnings of the Tupac Amaru rebellion to the political pragmatism of the Republic. By analyzing the emergence of public opinion, and the consolidation of the judicial system as a political arena, Walker shows how the will of the indigenous population was fundamental to the transition from Old Regime to Republic in Peru. Indeed, this study presents indigenous Andean people as politically active and engaged in everyday politics, negotiating their space in the national arena both before and after independence.
