      One Inca so inspired was José Gabriel Condorcanqui. In 1780, José Gabriel styled himself Tupac Amaru II and launched a rebellion that swept across southern Peru. Walker’s history brings his struggle to life, and breathes deep sadness into the horrific execution of José Gabriel and his wife and co-plotter Micaela Bastidas, after which the resistance staggered along for another two increasingly violent years. In 1821, South American patriots would declare Peru’s independence, but the contract of justice—however limited—created after the Spanish conquest died here.

      There are several books on the figure of Tupac Amaru. Yet the power of Walker´s book lies in his detailed and emotionally charged description of the sufferings endured by Tupac Amaru and his wife Micaela Bastidas before their death. The book brings to life the terrifying power of the most important indigenous rebellion of southern Peru between 1780 and 1783, as well as the promise of indigenous military power that later proved to be central for winning the war of independence.
