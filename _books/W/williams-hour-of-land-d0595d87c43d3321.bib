      Now of course I could point you to the [words of John Muir](http://www.yosemite.ca.us/john_muir_writings/our_national_parks/chapter_1.html), who wrote in 1901 that “thousands of tired, nerve-shaken, over-civilized people are beginning to find out that going to the mountains is going home…” Or I could direct you to Ed Abbey’s gorgeous (if sometimes ornery and misanthropic) [_Desert Solitaire: A Season in the Wilderness_](https://www.amazon.com/Desert-Solitaire-Wilderness-Edward-Abbey/dp/0345326490), first published in 1968. But instead, I’m choosing to recommend a contemporary perspective on the nation’s public lands. In her new book (and I recommend them all), Williams asks, “What is the relevance of our national parks in the twenty-first century—and how might these public commons bring us back home to a united state of humility?” (11) She suggests that our national parks are “holograms of an America born of shadow and light,” and in twelve essays grounded in visits to and interactions with people in twelve different parts of the parks system, Williams considers the complex past and possible futures of American public lands. In this year of the centennial of the National Parks System, Williams and the other authors listed here offer readers a chance to wander in wilderness—and park history more broadly—for at least a whole summer, to paraphrase Muir.
