      When people ask me why I’m into studying cannibals, my standard, glib response is that people are food, too—at least in some contexts. Watson’s book is excellent at examining multiple contexts in which ideas about cannibalism circulated: the Caribbean, Mexico, New France, and New England, from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries. She’s interested in looking specifically at how discourses, or portrayals, of cannibals were tied to ideas about gender and sexuality, and how those portrayals gave Europeans a firmer, more masculine hold in the New World.
