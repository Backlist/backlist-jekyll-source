    text: >
      The demonstrated linkages between slavery and banks, insurance companies, and other economic institutions have been central to understanding the continuing legacy of slavery in American life. Here, Wilder shows how money derived from slavery also helped build the most respected educational institutions in the United States, and how those schools in turn provided substance to the cultural and intellectual support for slavery well into the nineteenth century.
