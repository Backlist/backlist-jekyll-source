      Sidney’s Mintz’s questions about power take on new life in this book, which considers a wide array of topics from an American Studies perspective. Williams-Forson covers the history of black hucksters, as well as the uncomfortable place of chicken in portrayals of African American food and eating—but at the heart of this book is the revisited question of power relations. Williams-Forson’s emphasis on chicken, then—through her study of history, film criticism, literary sources, postcards, travel narratives, oral history, popular fiction, and comedy stand-up—makes this book more than a culinary microhistory. It explores how black women used chicken to define and exert themselves in racist and hostile environments.
