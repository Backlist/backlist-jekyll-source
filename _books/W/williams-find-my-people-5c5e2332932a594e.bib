      Nothing about American slavery was more heartbreaking than the fact that slaveholders routinely shattered black families. In this deeply moving book, Williams traces the usually unsuccessful efforts of newly emancipated people to find those family members who had been stolen from them, sometimes decades earlier, and demonstrates the profound fragmentation wrought upon the lives of black Americans by slavery, both as individuals and as a people.
