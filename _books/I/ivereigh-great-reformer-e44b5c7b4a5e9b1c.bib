      When Jesuit Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires was surprisingly elected pope in March 2013, most commentators outside Argentina had no clue about who the new pope was, nor imagined how far he would go in advancing his agenda of a “church for the poor.” Written by one of the few historians of Argentinean Catholicism in the Anglophone world, this book provides the best biography in English of Pope Francis. It reads his thought and career in light of Argentina’s tumultuous twentieth-century politics, the theological renewal that preceded and followed Vatican II, and the history of the Jesuits in South America. This is a book you have to read in order to understand a pope who is heading the most dramatic developments in the Catholic Church since the last ecumenical council.
