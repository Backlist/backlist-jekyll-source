      If Paracelsus and Newton captured your attention, you will enjoy delving more deeply into the stories of other people engaged in the study of nature—both male and female. Ray dispels the notion that early modern science was a world without women, guiding us through chemical experiments, books of medical and technical ‘recipes,’ arguments about the role women should occupy in scientific culture, and intellectual networks forged within Italian cities and across Europe. While names like Isabella Cortese and Margherita Sarrocchi are no longer familiar to us, Ray’s book demonstrates that they were well known in their own time and that these women, and their mastery of natural philosophy, commanded respect from contemporaries such as Galileo.
