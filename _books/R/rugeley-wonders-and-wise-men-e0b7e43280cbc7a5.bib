      Nineteenth-century Yucatán is commonly remembered as the site of the bloody “Caste War” of 1847-1901, in which indigenous Maya rebels, guided by a speaking crucifix, attempted to throw off the yoke of Ladino (non-Indian) governance and establish an autonomous state based in the fortress/shrine city of Chan Santa Cruz. Yet Terry Rugeley shows that Yucatecan Catholicism also provided a shared cultural edifice, divisible by culture and class but amounting to a larger whole. Urban festive culture and pious associations provided venues for cross-cultural encounter, and Yucatecans of all stripes partook in a cultural system centered on local devotions, miraculous apparitions, and powerful (and potentially enriching) images.
