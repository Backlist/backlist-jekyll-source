      As its title suggests, this book offers a unique study of the inner workings of the Holy See, whose intricate bureaucratic structure is often misunderstood in the mainstream media. From the papal conclave to the congregations, consistories, and synods, the book explains how each of the Vatican institutions came to be, how they operate on a regular basis, and how they affect the Catholic Church at large. Written by a Berkeley-trained political scientist and Jesuit, the book features over a hundred interviews with Vatican officials, a precious source that allows the reader to grasp the complexity of clerical politics as only an insider would.
