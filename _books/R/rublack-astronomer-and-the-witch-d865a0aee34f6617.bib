      In 1620, at the height of his scientific career, the Imperial Mathematician Johannes Kepler put his scientific books and instruments in storage, packed up his family and his bags, and returned to his birthplace in Germany. The reason? Kepler dropped everything in order to defend his seventy-year-old mother from accusations of witchcraft. The story of Katharina Kepler, and her son Johannes’s efforts to release her from prison, give poignant immediacy to the tensions between science and magic, religion and reason, continuity and change that lie at the very heart of the Scientific Revolution.
