      I considered putting Redniss’s book below, among the “New Moves,” but decided to leave it here with the slightly more traditional graphic histories.  Regardless, it’s an odd book that leans heavily on the author’s haunting, beautiful, and sometimes abstract images.  The art carries along a tragic story of the relationship between the past and the present, which is also built atop Redniss’s outstanding reporting.
