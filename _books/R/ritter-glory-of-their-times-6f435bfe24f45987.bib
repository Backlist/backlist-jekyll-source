      Columbia professor Ritter pioneered the use of oral history in the study of baseball. He traveled the country with a reel-to-reel recorder interviewing major leaguers who played from the turn of the century through the 1940s. _Glory_ provides the raw material of these interviews with only light editing. Other authors have followed Ritterâ€™s approach, and many have borrowed from his research, but none have provided such direct access to the voices and stories of men who played professionally during the early twentieth century.
