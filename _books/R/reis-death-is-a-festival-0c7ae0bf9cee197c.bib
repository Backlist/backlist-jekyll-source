      “Death to the Cemetery!” This fascinating read shows us how central death and dying were to life in nineteenth century Brazil. The book opens with the _Cemiterada Revolt_ of 1836, when a mob in the city of Salvador turned their rage on to the city’s newly built cemetery, completely destroying it – but why? João Reis takes us on a tour of the elaborate mortuary practices of the age, whose exuberant funeral processions included all the priests, processions, colorful shrouds and professional wailing women that money could buy. Yet even modest people spent time and money for their own as well as others’ funeral arrangements, and it was this coalition of everyday people, religious brotherhoods, and the wealthy who protested that the monopoly granted by the city to this new cemetery was a disruption of the beautiful business of dying.
