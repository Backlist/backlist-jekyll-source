      Written shortly after India and Pakistan tested nuclear missiles in the spring of 1998, this book by Arundhati Roy questions whether developing a nuclear program or building a large concrete dams in places where large parts of the population are living below the global poverty line makes economic or social sense.  Provocative and polemical, Roy’s critique of the Indian government’s policy decisions left me rethinking all national priorities that are enacted in the name of “development.”  Read this once you’ve read Ramachandra Guha and you’ll get a sense of some of the fault lines in how the history of modern India is written.
