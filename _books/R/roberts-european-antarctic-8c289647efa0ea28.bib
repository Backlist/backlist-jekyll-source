      Whereas Dodds’ _Pink Ice_ focuses primarily on one country, Roberts’ _The European Antarctic_ takes a more international approach to the geopolitical history of Antarctica in the first half of the twentieth century with an investigation of British, Swedish, and Norwegian Antarctic policy.  All three of these countries had a strong interest in the Antarctic whaling industry and Roberts shows how whale science played a central role in the politics of Antarctica during this period.  This was epitomized by the inter-war Discovery Investigations, which utilized Captain Scott’s former Antarctic ship to track the movement of whales and learn more about whale biology.
