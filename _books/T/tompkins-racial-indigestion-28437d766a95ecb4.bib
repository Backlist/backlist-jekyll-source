      Every time I talk about this book, I quote the same line: Tompkins hopes “to nudge food studies’ interests and methods away from an unreflective collaboration in the object-based fetishism of the foodie world, a collaboration that has produced an unending stream of single-commodity histories and ideologically worrisome localist politics.” My take on Mintz, above, should suggest how useful I think some culinary microhistories can be. But I agree with Tompkins that looking too hard at individual commodities makes readers think too much about what was eaten, rather than why and how it was eaten. Tompkins, by examining different sorts of material culture—chapbooks, cookbooks, poetry, novels, and visual culture—traces how eating became a political act that created “fictions of national unity.” I also really like this book because it’s a great reminder that anyone interested in food would do well to venture across the disciplinary aisle to think about what people in literary studies, food studies, and anthropology have to say.
