      In the second half of the 19th century, trans-Pacific migrations led to the formation of mixed-race families in the United States, China, and Hong Kong. How did these interracial families negotiate their sense of belonging and identity at a time when miscegenation was deeply frowned upon? In _Eurasian_, Emma Teng explores the lived experiences of transnational Eurasian communities and the development of ideas surrounding mixed race. Although historians of colonialism often argue that mixed-race populations were seen as a threat to white prestige and imperial power, Teng shows that Eurasians experienced not only discrimination, but also privilege.
