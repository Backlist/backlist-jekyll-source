    text: >
      This exemplary and ambitious anthropology was written independent of the archives, yet is a sustained musing on the nature of history and an archeology of the various layers of history-writing in the Xinjiang oases that ring the Tarim basin. Thum lingers over manuscripts, shrines and their caretakers, oral recitations, contemporary novels, and tomb graffiti, everywhere emphasizing local particularity rather than simple narratives of resistance to or domination by China.
