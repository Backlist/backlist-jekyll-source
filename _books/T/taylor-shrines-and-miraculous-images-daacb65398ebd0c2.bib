      The Guadalupan shrine at Tepayac is just one node of a larger network of holy places and miraculous images in Mexico, as Taylorâ€™s accessible and important book reminds us. Taylor introduces readers to overlooked devotions like the Cristo Renovado and the Virgen de Remedios, and raises intriguing questions about how historians use images as sources. The essays collected within skew to the colonial period, but their nuanced exploration of sacred immanence in religious icons and their analysis of changes and continuities in the faith after independence excavate the cultural bedrock upon which modern Mexican Catholicism was built.
