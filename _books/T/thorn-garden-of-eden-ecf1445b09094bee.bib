    text: >
      For decades, baseball’s origins have remained shrouded by the twin myths of Abner Doubleday and Alexander Cartwright creating the game. Thorn, the official historian of Major League Baseball, focuses less on debunking these myths than on explaining their construction. In doing so, he excavates the self-conscious process through which major league executives solidified their business’ status as the National Pastime.
