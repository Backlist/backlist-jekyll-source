      There are several excellent biographies of the man who broke baseball’s color barrier, but Tygiel’s concise and well-contextualized effort is the place to start. Tygiel moves beyond the “great men” myth and the more disturbing (and inaccurate) idea that Dodgers’ general manager Branch Rickey was the primary force behind desegregation to provide a more complex explanation of the forces that drove black men from the game during the late 1800s and that forced the door back open in 1946-47.
