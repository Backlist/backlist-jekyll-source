      If you must read a nineteenth-century traveler, let it be Vambery, master of the genre, an atheistic Jewish Turkologist from Budapest in disguise as an Istanbul effendi disguised again as a Sufi dervish on pilgrimage to the saints’ tombs of Central Asia just before the Russian conquest. Although suspicions about his identity abounded, the self-aggrandizing writer nonetheless found audience with local rulers and commented on Teheran (where the “East” began for him), the barbaric ways of the Turkmen, and his “bitter disappointment” with the architectural merits of Samarkand, which include Tamerlane’s tomb and the Registan square. Absolutely prodigious yet completely a creature of his time; you will enjoy traveling at his side.
