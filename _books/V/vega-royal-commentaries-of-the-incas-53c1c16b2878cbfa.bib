      The Incas never left. In the early seventeenth century, the son of an Inca princess and a conquistador published this history of his mother’s people, of the greatness that he believed the Spanish had misunderstood. Some of Garcilaso’s memories are a little too golden, but their beauty helped Europe understand what had been lost. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Garcilaso inspired Indians and Spaniards alike to take up arms again in the name of an Inca kingdom, or republic, reborn.
