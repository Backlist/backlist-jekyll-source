      By now we’re probably all familiar with the term “hangriness,” or the feeling of being simultaneously hungry and angry. Today we feel justified feeling angry when we’re hungry because for many of us, food shortages are not a problem. Yet as James Vernon reminds us, this is a very new development, indeed. In this book, Vernon suggests that only during the nineteenth century did people begin to hold the state responsible for hunger prevention. He traces how Great Britain acknowledged hunger as an imperial and then a global problem requiring political movements, statecraft, and new forms of international redress to avoid hunger.
