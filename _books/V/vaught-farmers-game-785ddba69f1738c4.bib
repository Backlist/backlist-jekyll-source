      Historians have mostly characterized baseball as an urban game filled with pastoral imagery. Vaught’s collection of essays push past the longstanding focus on major league and other forms of urban baseball to consider the relationship between the game and rural America. He argues that the rural values of the game are real rather than mythological, and that the game has long aligned with the values and interests of American farmers. From early nineteenth-century games in Cooperstown, NY to vintage baseball played in early twenty-first century Texas, Vaught reorients baseball history to incorporate the cultures of rural America.
