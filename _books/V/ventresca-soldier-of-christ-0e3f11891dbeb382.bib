      Ever since the publication in 1999 of John Cornwell’s highly contentious _Hitler’s Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII_, the historiography of the modern papacy has been dominated by the so-called “Pius wars,” that is, by the heated discussions about the role played by Pope Pius XII–and the Catholic Church at large–during the Holocaust. Unlike most participants in that debate, Ventresca does not judge the pope according to counterfactual claims about what he should have done, but rather limits himself to assess what Pius XII did and why. The result is a sober and well-researched biography, which sheds light into a man obsessed with protecting the Church against Communism, and who nonetheless failed to grasp the true nature and scale of the Nazi war against the Jews.
