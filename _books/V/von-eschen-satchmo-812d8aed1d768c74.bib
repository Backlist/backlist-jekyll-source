      Scholars have produced dozens of case studies of cultural diplomacy programs. _Satchmo Blows Up the World_ is one of the best. The storytelling is great, but read it for Von Eschenâ€™s attention to how jazz diplomacy played (sorry!) in the postcolonial world. Particularly in Africa, local audiences pressed touring musicians to explain the dismal U.S. record on race. Their responses were not always what the State Department had in mind.
