      The history of the modern papacy is inextricably linked with that of the two ecumenical councils that articulated the Catholic response to the multiple revolutions of the modern world. If the First Vatican Council (1869-70) paved the way for an unprecedented assertion of papal power, the Second (1962-65) sought to reverse that trend by favoring religious freedom, greater lay participation, and true collegiality between the bishops and the pontiff. Among the best of its kind in any language, Father O’Malley’s book places the Second Vatican Council in historical perspective and provides a detailed narrative of the main debates, moments, and personalities that defined this crucial meeting. For the author, Vatican II is unique not only for its results, but also for its style, which substituted the legal formulations of previous councils for a more pastoral language based in the patristic tradition.
