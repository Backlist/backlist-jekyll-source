      This groundbreaking investigation of healing plant knowledge and pharmaceuticals in Sub-Saharan Africa is grouped into highly original chapters like “Take Grains of Paradise for Love” and “Take Kalahari Hoodia for Hunger.” Osseo-Assare is especially good on the question of how European bioprospecting stripped plants of their larger social and religious contexts.
