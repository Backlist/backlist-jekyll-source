      Before O’Phelan Godoy undertook this path-breaking study, there had been no systematic attempts at understanding the dramatic rise in the number of indigenous rebellions in eighteenth century Peru. Moreover, little attention had been given to revolts other than the Tupac Amaru rebellion. O´Phelan Godoy not only covers them all, she also identifies three phases of conflict: the first from 1726-1737, against tribute and _mita_ increases; a second between 1751-1756 against the _reparto_ (the forced sale of merchandise to indigenous communities); and a final one between 1777-1781, including the Tupac Amaru rebellion. Her main argument is that vast sectors of the society took part in the rebellions, arguably challenging the legitimacy of Spanish domination throughout the eighteenth century.
