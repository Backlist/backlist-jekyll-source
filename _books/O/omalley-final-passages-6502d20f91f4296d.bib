      Though the transatlantic slave trade and the interior domestic slave trade that thrived in the nineteenth century are relatively well known, O’Malley shows that there was an extensive intercolonial forced migration as well. The transport nightmare for Africans in colonial British North America did not necessarily end when they first arrived on western shores, but rather could continue as they were trafficked among colonies, which contributed to the power and expansion of the British empire.
