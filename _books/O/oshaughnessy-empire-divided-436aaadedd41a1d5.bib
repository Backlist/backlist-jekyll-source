      For anyone interested in the British Caribbean during the American Revolution, O’Shaughnessy’s _An Empire Divided_ is the book to read. It reminds readers that Britain’s American Empire consisted of both mainland and West Indian colonies. O’Shaughnessy questions why these latter colonies chose to remain loyal to the British Empire while thirteen of their mainland counterparts did not. In the process, _An Empire Divided_ inspires readers to discard any assumptions of the revolution’s inevitability, and reminds us that the consequences of the revolution were born by more than Britain and the nascent United States.
