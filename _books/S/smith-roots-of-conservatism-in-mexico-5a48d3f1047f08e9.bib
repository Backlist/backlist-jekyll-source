      Long dismissed by historians as the creed of self-serving oligarchs, duplicitous clerics, and duped peasants, conservatism is experiencing a renaissance among scholars of Mexico. Smith’s book explains its appeal by zeroing in on the history of Oaxaca’s Mixteca Baja, a region where the indigenous majority faithfully defended their priests and the private property regime against successive generations of liberal and revolutionary reformers. The region’s version of conservatism was built on a moral economy of unequal but reciprocal obligations among mestizo landowners, indigenous nobles, and commoners, and it also relied upon a relatively harmonious relationship between official and indigenous/popular variants of the Catholic faith. This durable material and symbolic system even led Mixtecan peasants to take up arms in the short-lived Catholic revolt knows as the “Last Cristiada” in 1962.
