      Museum archaeologists used their connections, prestige, and influence to engage in a particularly competitive race to gather the best archaeological materials from the American Southwest. The indigenous peoples who created societies and lived there for centuries stood up to these efforts for decades if not far longer, before a massive awakening on the issue alongside the American Indian Movement in the 1970s. Over time, this would lead to monumental legislative achievements including the 1989 National Museum of the American Indian Act and the 1990 Native American Graves Protection or Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). NAGPRA created a legal framework through which Native American tribes, like those throughout the Southwest, could demand the return of sacred artifacts and ancestral human remains from museums receiving federal funding. In 2015, the National Park Service estimated that 50,518 individual sets of human remains have been returned to tribes.
