    text: >
      For much of its existence, jazz literature has been dominated by big-arch narrative histories of stylistic change. Perhaps the best of this genre, Shiptonâ€™s overview stands squarely in this tradition, but it steps up to a broader perch, incorporating not just recent research on the music and musicians but also strong components of social and cultural history.
