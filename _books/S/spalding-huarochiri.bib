      The Incas were conquerors too. How did they compare to the Spaniards, from the perspective of Indians who werenâ€™t rich and powerful? The modern social history of the Andes began here, as Spalding plumbed Peruvian archives to show how Spanish rule constricted the wealth, health, and land of smaller groups already living on the edge.
