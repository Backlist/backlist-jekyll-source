      Alexander and Anne Shulgin’s _PiKHAL_ (short for _Phenethylamines I Have Known And Loved_) is a personal history written by the celebrated UC Berkeley-trained biochemist and his wife, who were known for self-experimenting with various novel drugs of their own manufacture (Shulgin’s most famous invention is MDMA). It is also, uniquely, an eccentric but highly detailed chemistry manual.
