      Sutter begins this book by tracing the rise of the automobile in twentieth-century America, and uses this history to argue that modern wilderness preservation grew out of a critique of consumption. He takes a biographical approach, and uses the stories of Aldo Leopold, Robert Sterling Yard, Benton MacKaye, and Bob Marshall to explore how conservation practitioners in the interwar era became wilderness advocates.
