      A rare piece of Central Asian autobiographical writing to have been translated into English, Shayakhmetov’s memoir covers events that are woefully unfamiliar outside of the region: the ethnic Kazakh famine of nearly genocidal proportions during collectivization and the Kazakhs’ brave and proud service in World War II—the first time Central Asian men fought side-by-side with Russians in the phenomenally diverse Red Army.
