      Told from the perspective of a young child, Leni, as she watches her household change through the course of the 1947 partition, the novel explains more than a historical monograph could about the dramatic and momentous changes ordinary people went through when the British left the subcontinent and created India and Pakistan.  Made into a powerful film titled _Earth_, by the acclaimed director, Deepa Mehta, the story showcases the dramatic changes in one family.
