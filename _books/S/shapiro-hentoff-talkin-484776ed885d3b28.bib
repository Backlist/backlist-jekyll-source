      Hentoff and Shapiro stand in for the critics and producers who have had such a role defining the categorical boundaries, canon, and interpretation of jazz. In _Hear Me Talkin’ To Ya_, however, they put the voices of the musicians first, compiling the story of jazz with a series of interview segments and oral histories. In terms of its formal structure, it is a remarkable book of modernist history; in terms of testimony, it captures a significant body of observation and feeling that would not be otherwise available.
