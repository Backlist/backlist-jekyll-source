      This is an equally good place to begin. Though not structured as a chronological investigation of the idea of wilderness, Solnit’s _Savage Dreams_ engages with the major themes of national park history and historiography, as well as environmental history more broadly. How she does it—through a beautifully written meditation on the interconnected histories of the Nevada Test Site and Yosemite National Park—makes this one of the books I most regularly recommend to my friends (and assign to my students).
