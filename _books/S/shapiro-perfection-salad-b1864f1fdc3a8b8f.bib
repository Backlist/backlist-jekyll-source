      Everything you wanted to know about why nineteenth- and twentieth-century Americans were really into covering food with white, gloopy sauces. In all seriousness, though, Shapiro’s book was significant for its ability to think about how and why race mattered to white middle-class cooks at the turn of the century. By professionalizing cooking—making ingredients measurable, standardizing cooking times, and making recipes scientific—middle class progressive women sought to elevate the domestic, private roles of housewives. The Boston basis of this move toward standardization meant that New England dishes were readily accepted, while heavily-spiced immigrant dishes were not. White food and white sauce also added a pure, racial element to discussions about food at the time.
