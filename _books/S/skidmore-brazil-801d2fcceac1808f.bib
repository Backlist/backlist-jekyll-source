      Skidmore’s classic has long been used as a textbook for introductory courses on Brazil. It gives a broad narrative history of the country since the times of Portuguese colonization all the way to the country’s re-democratization process in the 1980s and 90s. An accessible read, it provides both a concise narrative of five hundred years of history as well as critical insights into Brazilian culture and the many inequalities that still plague the country.
