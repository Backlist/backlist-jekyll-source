      Set in Algeria’s Jewish community during the 1920s, this is the story of a rabbi and his cat, who consumes a parrot and acquires the ability to speak. The cat, after studying Torah with the rabbi, naturally decides that as a Jew, he must be bar mitzvahed. The rabbi remains skeptical but decides to approach his mentor for advice. Hilarity and hijinks—and serious discussions about the importance (or not) and origins of religious strictures, as well as the nature of humanity—ensue.
