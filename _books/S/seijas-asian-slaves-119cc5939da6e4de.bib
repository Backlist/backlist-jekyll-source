      In 1610, Catarina de San Juan, a young woman from South Asia, was sold as a slave in the markets of Manila, and shipped off to Puebla, Mexico. Between the 17th and 18th centuries, countless slaves from South and Southeast Asia, like Catarina de San Juan, were taken to Mexico to work in textile mills, artisanal trades, and domestic households. Tatiana Seijas takes her readers back in time to explore their journeys of survival in the trans-Pacific slave trade and the creative strategies these men and women adopted to overcome bondage.
