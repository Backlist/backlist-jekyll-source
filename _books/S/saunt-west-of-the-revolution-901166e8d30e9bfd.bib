      Like countless studies of the American Revolution, Saunt frames his book around the year 1776—the very year congressional delegates signed the Declaration of Independence. Yet, neither the signers of the declaration, nor the colonies they represented factor prominently in what Saunt describes “an uncommon history” of that year. Instead, West of the Revolution provides a window into histories of North America that have more to do with the Spanish and Russian empires, together with the Native peoples that often helped shape imperial relations. By situating himself on the periphery of more conventional histories of the period, Saunt masterfully succeeds at marginalizing that which seems to dominate any history of 1776. By doing so, he equips readers with a richer understanding of the North American interior and its significance for making sense of the Revolutionary Era.
