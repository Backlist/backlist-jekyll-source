      Though less than a decade old, this book became an instant “classic” thanks to its clear and comprehensive overview of fifty years of U.S. policy toward the Cuban Revolution. It provides a nuanced analysis of the ideological roots of U.S. leaders’ multiple misguided attempts to determine Cuba’s fate.
