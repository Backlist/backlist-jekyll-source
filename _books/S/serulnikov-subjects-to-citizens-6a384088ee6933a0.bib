      The rebellions of the 1780s mobilized thousands of Indians, constituting the greatest challenge to colonial authority in the history of Spanish America. Serulnikov´s study demonstrates how the Bourbon monarchy’s reforms—which sought to improve the general administration of the viceroyalty, in particular in the fiscal and military realms—had an unexpected and revolutionary effect upon indigenous Andean communities. By examining the rebellion of Tupac Katari and his followers, Serulnikov shows that Andean revolts were rooted in a radical anti-colonial thought and local interethnic cooperation that gave them the strength to assert their rights and subvert the law.
