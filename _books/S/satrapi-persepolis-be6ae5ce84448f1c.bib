      Among the most lauded graphic books ever, _Persepolis_ is a great place to start, because Satrapi masterfully straddles the line between history and memory.  Her story of growing up during the Islamic Revolution in Iran manages to be at once panoramic and also deeply personal.  The extraordinarily simple art, all done in black and white, somehow underscores the emotional impact of the narrative.
