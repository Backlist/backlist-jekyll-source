      Odell Shepard was a man of many talents: a Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut, Yale professor, and celebrated poet, he also found time to write this delightful history of unicorns which delves in loving detail into the purported medical virtues of “unicorn horn” and other mythical animal parts.
