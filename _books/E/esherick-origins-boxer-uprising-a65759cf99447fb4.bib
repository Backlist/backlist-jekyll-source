      A meticulously researched study of the anti-Christian militants, dubbed “Boxers” by Westerners of the time, who captured global attention in 1900 by laying siege to Beijing’s foreign legations. A state-of-the-art example of ethnographically minded bottom-up history (and what Cohen dubbed “China-centered” work), it teases out the roles of local tensions and popular culture in shaping the actions of the Boxers. Esherick puts to rest the misleading notion that they were anti-dynastic rebels.
