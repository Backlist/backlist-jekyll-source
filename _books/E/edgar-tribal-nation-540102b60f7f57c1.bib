      This textured portrayal of the unlikely creation of a socialist nation among the Turkmen nomads depicts locals not as victims but opportunistic, feuding, and crafty partners, employing Soviet language and concepts to create a Turkmen homeland. Edgar shows that especially in Turkmenistan the twin Soviet projects of nation-building and socialist construction worked at cross purposes and produced contradictory results.
