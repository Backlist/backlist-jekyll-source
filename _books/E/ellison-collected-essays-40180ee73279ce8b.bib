      Ground-breaking in their moment, Ellison’s essays on music remain some of the most magisterial and illuminating works of American cultural criticism around. For those who just want his jazz pieces, one can look to the collection _Living with Music_, but I think reading them in the company of his ruminations on American identity, literature, and racial dynamics more fully reveals the deep and complex interconnections going on in Ellison’s thought and texts.
