      Ehrenberg’s insightful work demonstrates that, despite its long-held reputation as the definition of the commercial mainstream, big band music in the 1930s was, in fact, a vehicle for progressive New Deal politics and a vision of democratic pluralism. This essential book connects the production and reception of jazz to its social world and political moment, bringing together Duke Ellington and Benny Goodman with the interwar Popular Front, and jitterbug dancers with new visions of sexuality and greater racial inclusiveness.
