      Khalid’s book is a handy guide to the region’s Soviet history with special attention to the Communist Party’s religious policies of extermination and subsequent accommodation. It is eloquent yet polemical in its defense of local Islam as on the continuum of modern iterations of the faith, despite the region’s relative lack of madrassas and the preponderance of local hosts eager to share a shot of vodka with their guests.
