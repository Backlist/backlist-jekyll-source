      This book narrates the last years of the Papal States through the story of the “Mortara scandal,” which began with the kidnapping in 1858 of a six-year old Jewish boy by the Roman Inquisition in Bologna, after claims that the boy had been secretly baptized by a Christian servant. Kertzer interweaves the judicial records of the case with private correspondence and the varied reactions of the contemporary press in Europe and America: the scandal galvanized liberal opinion against the anachronistic theocratic regime ruled by Pope Pius IX, and helped convince French Emperor Napoleon III, until then the pope’s main protector, to lend his support to the unification of Italy under Piedmontese rule.
