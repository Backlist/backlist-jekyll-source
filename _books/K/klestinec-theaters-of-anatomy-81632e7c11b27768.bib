      Having spent time in the workshops and academies of late 17th-century London, you’re now equipped to deal with the harsh realities of Venetian medical culture. While most historians of early modern medicine have focused on important anatomic texts such as Andreas Vesalius’s _On the Fabric of the Human Body_ (1543), Klestinec is more interested in how medical practitioners and the general public came together to study the human body in the anatomical theatres that were popping up in European cities. Like Jardine, Klestinec has a marvelous eye for anecdotes and stories found in the archives, which she uses to bring this story of students, teachers, and audiences to vivid life.
