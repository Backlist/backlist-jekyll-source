      Awarded the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Biography, this captivating book explores the love-and-hate relationship between Pope Pius XI and the “Duce” of Fascist Italy, Benito Mussolini. Kertzer rightly places the Lateran Accords of 1929 as a pivotal moment in that relationship, but then shows how the recognition of Vatican sovereignty and the restoration of Catholicism as the official religion of the state in Italy ended up lessening the Church’s freedom of action and even silencing the pope’s own voice against the growing identification of Mussolini with Hitler’s Germany. Since the book is based on both Vatican and Fascist intelligence files, it is filled with shocking details about court intrigues, hidden scandals, and off-the-record negotiations. In other words, it almost reads like a real-life spy thriller.
