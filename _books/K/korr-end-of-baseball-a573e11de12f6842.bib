    text: >
      One of the most glaring needs within the historiography of baseball is a readable, scholarly one-volume history of labor relations within the industry. Until that book appears, a good option for readers interested in the struggles between baseball players and management is Korr’s book on the pivotal period between 1966 and 1981. Korr is the first historian to have access to the papers of the players’ union, the Major League Baseball Players Association, and his book does an admirable job of explaining the transformative conflicts of this era.
