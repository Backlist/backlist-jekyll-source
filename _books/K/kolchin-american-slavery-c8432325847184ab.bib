      Kolchinâ€™s synthesis provides both an overview of American slavery from its beginnings in the colonial era through its collapse during the Civil War, and a sense of the scholarly shifts in thinking about the institution over time. Those looking for a relatively brief and readable introduction to the subject will find nothing better.
