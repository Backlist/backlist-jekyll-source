      _Africa Speaks, America Answers_ is part of a long, important wave of work that has expanded the geography of jazz beyond the U.S. borders. Through a discussion of two African and two African American musicians—Guy Warren, Sathima Bea Benjamin, Randy Weston, and Ahmed Abdul-Malik—Kelley builds an analytical and musical space between the two continents, showing how important jazz was to Africans and Africa was to Americans in the era of decolonization.
