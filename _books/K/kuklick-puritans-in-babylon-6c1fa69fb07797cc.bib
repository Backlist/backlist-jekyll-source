      The most widely read book in the nineteenth century United States was the Bible, and American archaeologists at the time sought connections between its stories by turning to the Ancient World. The University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, and Johns Hopkins University were among the many places sponsoring large expeditions to what are now Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Israel. Not only did a huge number of artifacts come back to museums in the United States as a result of these early archaeological expeditions, they were widely reported in popular media.
