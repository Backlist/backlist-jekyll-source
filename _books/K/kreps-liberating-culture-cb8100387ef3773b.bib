      Museums arguably originated in Western societies, but have since spread to nearly every part of the world. Using the case of the Museum Balanga in the former Dutch colony of Indonesia, Kreps, a museum expert and anthropologist, interrogates how Eurocentric museum ideals have deeply influenced emerging non-Western museums. She compares how this museum and others in the region have worked to free themselves from traditional museum practices and upend “traditional” assumptions in heritage preservation. It shows how context deeply shapes and potentially reorients what is appropriate in a museum context.
