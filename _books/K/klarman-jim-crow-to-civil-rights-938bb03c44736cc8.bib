      Jim Crow was, in one sense, a collection of deep-seated racial anxieties about maintaining white supremacy codified into law. In _From Jim Crow to Civil Rights_, Michael Klarman traces the shifting social consensus on segregation among whites through legal challenges brought before the Supreme Court. Klarman pushes past the courtroom doors, exploring broader social transformations through the work of civil rights activists, politicians, and white supremacist groups. Ultimately, he argues that, just as racial anxieties produced Jim Crow, public opinion moved the Supreme Court far more than the cultural elitism of the justices themselves.
