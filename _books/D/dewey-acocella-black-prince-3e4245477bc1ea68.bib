      Biographies of professional baseball players generally either strive to celebrate the career (and sometimes the life) of the subject, or to offer insights into the psychological and environmental factors that shaped him. Dewey and Accocella take a more historical approach, portraying Hal Chase, a fine first baseman and legendary rapscallion, as a compelling representative of the baseball industry during the Deadball Era (1900-1920).
