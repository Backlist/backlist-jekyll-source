      This classic text is unsurpassed in its sheer elegance, poignancy, and power. Published at the height of Jim Crow, these essays (and a stray short story) capture the struggles of African Americans at what Du Bois calls “the dawn of freedom,” a moment when the promise of American democracy both seemed most possible and yet remained remote. You experience Du Bois at his best in this book: his acerbic wit, his uncompromising zeal for justice, his deep empathy for the “folk” he writes about.
