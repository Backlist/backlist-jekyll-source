      A pioneering work of “New Jazz Studies,” _The Birth of Bebop_ is a crucial book in the deconstruction of the evolution-propelled view of traditional jazz historiography. DeVeaux makes an excellent case that bebop was not just a paradigm shift in terms of style, but also an answer to a crisis in the economic opportunities of African Americans in the late Swing period.
