      DuValâ€™s most recent study brings into focus regions, individuals, and even revolutionary struggles that are regularly obscured in histories of the period. She approaches the American Revolution from the Gulf Coast, and in doing so reminds her readers that most individuals participated in the War for Independence for reasons that were regionally or personally specific. By focusing on the Gulf Coast and the many individuals who inhabited the region, DuVal also depicts an imperial world that was made up of various forms of interdependence. Her book suggests that while one form of independence was secured in 1783, other forms were stamped out.
