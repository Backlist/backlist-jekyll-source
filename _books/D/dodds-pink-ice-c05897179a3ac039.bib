      Klaus Dodd’s _Pink Ice_ offers a detailed analysis of Great Britain's various strategies for making political claims to the Antarctic continent. The British labeled the Antarctic Peninsula region directly to the south of South America the "Falkland Islands Dependencies," and the ongoing tension over the ownership of the Falkland Islands/Islas Malvinas meant that Britain’s political dispute with Argentina would extend all the way to the South Pole.  This is a pioneering work on the geopolitics of Antarctica, which has helped to lay a foundation for other studies on the continent’s political history.
