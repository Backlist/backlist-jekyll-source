      Isaac Newton was a great mathematician, but he was a man of words, too. When Newton died in 1727, leaving no will, millions of those words were left in manuscript. His family looked through the papers and realized that there was an awful lot of religious heresy and alchemy mixed in with the mathematics. Not surprisingly, the family suppressed those manuscripts that painted an unflattering, unscientific, and unorthodox portrait of their heroic relative. Sarah Dry follows the now-scattered papers across the globe, tracking their fate with the persistence of a detective to better understand how and why the Newton manuscripts remained so unknown for so long. Dry’s book is an excellent reminder that the history of something as significant and challenging as the Scientific Revolution will always be, first and last, the tale we are able—and choose—to tell.
