      To return one of Miles’s own unforgettable compliments, his autobiography is “cleaner than a broke dick dog,” a testament to Davis’s total modeling of the cool as persona, attitude, myth, and sound. At the same time, it’s a poignant example of the authority of a masterful first-person chronicler and, in its apparent recycling of other people’s material, its fragility.
