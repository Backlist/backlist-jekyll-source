      To understand whatâ€™s so peculiar about the papacy over the last two centuries, it helps to begin with a broad understanding of its two-millennium history. Beautifully written by one of the best historians of Catholicism in the English language, this book provides an excellent overview of how the pontiffs, from Saint Peter to Pope Francis, managed to build, preserve, and gradually increase their spiritual power in the Church. Well-informed and richly contextualized, it also includes a very useful bibliographical essay.
