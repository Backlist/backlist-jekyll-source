      The violence of Jim Crow played out in the everyday lives of African Americans, but its most disturbing and visible manifestation was lynching. Crystal Feimsterâ€™s book uncovers how lynching was more than racial terror. Her gendered readings of lynching rituals, including the lynching of women, and public debates over lynching and rape reveal how these violent rituals not only reinforced white supremacy but the patriarchy too. Although rituals of racial and gendered violence in the United States have changed, popular representations of African Americans continue to criminalize black men as sexual predators and render the rape of black women invisible.
