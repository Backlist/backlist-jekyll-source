      Though Freedberg’s book is more than a decade old, and might not therefore qualify strictly as a “new move” any more, it deserves a place in this category because of the attention it drew to the importance of the visual image in the history of science and medicine. Freedberg did so in the most unexpected of ways, by sharing the results of a good rummage through Queen Elizabeth’s cupboards in Windsor Castle’s library. He was looking for something else, and instead discovered hundreds of early 17th-century natural history illustrations made for the Lincean Academy in Rome, whose most famous member was Galileo. Freedberg’s work put technologies of seeing and modes of representation at the heart of the history of science, taking the field in new and fruitful directions. _The Eye of the Lynx_ is a visual as well as an intellectual treat, and every turn of the page makes it clear how seeing could lead to believing with the new science.
