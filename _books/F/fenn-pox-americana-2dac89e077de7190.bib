      Fenn’s _Pox Americana_ is recommended reading for anyone interested in the ways non-human actors influenced historical events during the Revolutionary Era. This book, like the epidemic, is not limited to regions directly affected by the Revolutionary War, and is therefore a broader study of smallpox throughout much of North America (including, for instance, Quebec, Pensacola, and Mexico City). Yet, Fenn devotes a substantial section of her book to smallpox’s role in the American Revolutionary War. She demonstrates the way the virus and immunity shaped military outcomes, military strategy, and overall morale in the early years of the war. Moreover, Fenn’s broader geographic scope provides a way to look past the thirteen colonies, and even past the Revolution entirely.
