      Like all good works of fiction, Faulknerâ€™s southern gothic tale of Thomas Sutpen provides insight and a kind of truth that works of scholarship sometimes cannot. Arriving seemingly from nowhere in frontier Mississippi, Sutpen uses slave labor to build an empire that he mistakenly believed could exorcise his demons. In the process, he succeeds only in obliterating himself, his family, and everything he had tried to build.
