      George Fredrickson’s _White Supremacy_ may seem more like digging out than digging in since he travels back to a time before Jim Crow and crosses the Atlantic to South Africa, but his comparative history of the United States and South Africa reveals quite pointedly what made Jim Crow distinctly American and yet part of a global story of racial oppression. Other historians so often (and often deservedly so) chide Americanists for their provincialism, but Fredrickson’s scholarship is comparative history at its best. I would also suggest reading Fredrickson’s companion volume, [_Black Liberation: A Comparative History of Black Ideologies in the United States and South Africa_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0195109783/ref=nosim/backlist0e-20) (1996).
