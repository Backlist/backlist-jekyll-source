      Arranged marriages and the need for elite men to travel to advance their careers meant that there was little expectation for marital affection in late imperial China. This book is the exception to the rule, as Shen Fu recalls his love for his deceased wife, YÃ¼n. A tender and affecting piece of writing, it also reminds us that the modes and manners of love have a history.
