      While this book focuses mostly on domestic Cuban struggles for independence from Spain in the late nineteenth century, its insights into racial politics help readers appreciate the significant cultural distance between the United States and Cuba. Ferrer convincingly demonstrates that Cuban nationalism and the effects of U.S. imperialism are impossible to understand without looking at the multiracial fighting force that led and then lost Cubaâ€™s war for true independence and racial equality.
