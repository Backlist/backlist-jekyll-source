      Antonio José Dutra was born in the Kingdom of Congo sometime in the early nineteenth century and brought to Brazil as a slave. During his life in Brazil, he was not only able to purchase his own freedom but also his own slaves, dying in 1849 as a man of considerable wealth in Rio de Janeiro. Via serious socio-economic research, Zephyr explains the kind of complex urban world in which such a feat would be possible, demonstrating that prior to the end of the slave trade in 1850, becoming a slave owner was the best investment a person of middling wealth – even an ex-slave – could make.
