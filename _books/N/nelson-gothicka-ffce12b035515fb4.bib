    text: 'Victoria Nelson wrote one of the more innovative recent contributions to the study of horror with her 2012 _Gothicka_. Nelson takes the reader effortlessly through an interestingly experimental description of the nature of the “Gothic.” She brings her reading of the classic eighteenth- and nineteenth-century gothic forward to the present to examine phenomena as diverse as _Twilight_ and contemporary Halloween celebrations. Her argument, that contemporary pop culture has begun the process of actively creating a new post-Christian religion out of our new world of gods and monsters, didn’t ultimately convince me. However, that’s a bit like saying I wasn’t convinced that the creatures in my favorite haunted house attraction were really trying to kill me. I’d still pay the admission price over and over again.'
