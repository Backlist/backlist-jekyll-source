      What was it like to encounter tobacco for the first time? What about chocolate, which before the 18th century was typically drunk cold and mixed with chili peppers? Nortonâ€™s outstanding history of these two beloved yet controversial drugs evokes both the strangeness of the encounter with New World substances in Europe and the indigenous contexts of ceremonial use in Pre-Columbian America.
