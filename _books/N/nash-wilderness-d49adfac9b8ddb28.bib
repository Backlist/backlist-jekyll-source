      If youâ€™re looking for a broad cultural history of how Americans imagined their relationship with nature, this book by Roderick Nash is a wonderful place to start. _Wilderness and the American Mind_ is still in print (five editions later), and for good reason. Nash traces the idea of wilderness from the Old World to the New, from Romanticism to debates over the formation and later protection of the national parks and on through to contemporary environmentalism.
