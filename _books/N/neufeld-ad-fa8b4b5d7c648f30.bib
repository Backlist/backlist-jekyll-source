      Neufeld follows a group of six New Orleanians before, during, and after Hurricane Katrina, rendering an epic catastrophe human in scale.  Originally published as a web comic, the book itself is a lovely object:  printed on thick paper and in color.  Along with Jed Horneâ€™s [_Breach of Faith_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0812976509/ref=nosim/clionautics-20), this is my favorite history of Katrina.
