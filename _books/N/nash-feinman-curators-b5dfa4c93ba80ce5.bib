      This remarkable and under-recognized book makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of museum anthropology in the United States by exploring the story of one institution: The Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. A carefully developed series of essays shows, for example, how expeditions became spectacular successes or tense failures. Biographical pieces show curators to be passionate and occasionally obsessive—sometimes more comfortable in the faraway place where they conduct fieldwork than at “home” in Chicago. For historians, it also contains useful data: appendices showing how many anthropology expeditions and exhibitions happened in any given year, and lists of museum staff and their tenure.
