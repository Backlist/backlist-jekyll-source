      “Public History” as a field outside academia had its start in the federal government’s nineteenth and twentieth century investments in preserving and interpreting natural and cultural resources—efforts that became our, per the title, museums, monuments, and National Parks. It was not until the emergence of history programs in the National Park Service in the 1920s and 1930s that ‘public history’ found an institutional home. The challenge of this federal support for history was that professional historians found themselves at times at odds with the thrust to memorialize, rather than interpret, key spaces in the American story.
