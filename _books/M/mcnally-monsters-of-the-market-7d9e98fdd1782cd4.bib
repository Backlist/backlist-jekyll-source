    text: 'David McNally’s _Monsters of the Market: Zombies, Vampires and Global Capitalism_ (2011) makes a convincing argument that our monstrous pop culture obsessions are hard wired into global economic systems and the horrors of postindustrial colonialism. Many readers are familiar with the numerous gothic tropes Marx employs in [_Capital_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0140445684/ref=nosim/backlist0e-20), with vampires, specters, and bloody corpses used to explore the nature of world capitalism and its effects. McNally makes full use of this imagery and ties together our current fascination with big and small screen zombies with a strange collection of contemporary rumor legends from sub-Saharan African and the deadly effects of postcolonial capital. In fact, if you still haven’t figured out what exactly happened with Enron in 2008, McNally will explain to you what he calls “the occult economies of late capital globalization.”'
