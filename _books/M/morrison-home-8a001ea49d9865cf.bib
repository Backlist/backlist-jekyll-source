      By the time Frank finally returns home to Lotus, Georgia, the “pink cotton blossoms spread under the malevolent sun” that greet him betray the innocence and renewal of springtime. They will fall away and become hardened bolls to be picked. He has journeyed far, from the Korean War, carrying traumatic memories of war and of this place he calls home—this country that boasts of its democracy abroad yet refuses to give him rest. Toni Morrison’s _Home_ evokes memory and trauma, home and community, race and violence, and she subtly captures the invisible hand of Jim Crow that displaces, pushes, and drives Frank away from home and back.
