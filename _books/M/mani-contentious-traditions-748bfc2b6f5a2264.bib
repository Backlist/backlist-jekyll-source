      Published well over a decade after the article of the same title, this book transformed how we think about debates over the status of women.  Taking _sati_ (the practice of widow-burning) as her focus, Mani argues that debates between Indian elites and colonial officials about this inhumane act allowed men to speak on behalf of women as a way to claim political authority.  Rescuing Indian women from Indian men became a colonial alibi that enabled further British intervention.
