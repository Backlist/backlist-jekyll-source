      What is the history behind passports, visas, and travel documents? _Melancholy Order_ explores how the proliferation of these documents is directly linked the history of modern migration control, which emerged as a system of racial exclusion barring Asian immigration into white settler colonies and nations at the turn of the 20th century. McKeown argues that the distinction between “free” and “unfree” migrations are not merely descriptive terms, but instead were used to justify the exclusion of “unfree” Asian migrants to places like Australia, Canada, and the United States. The regulation of Asian mobility, as this book shows, is crucial to our historical understanding of international migration control.
