      While many historians of the last decades have focused on indigenous participation in the process of independence, Marks offers a refreshing look at the anxieties and attitudes of the _limeño_ elite. By analyzing the relationship between merchants, bureaucrats, and the military, Marks shows that the Spanish crown was able to endure in Peru because of the similarity of political and economic interests among these groups. However, the division of the elite over economic disputes led to the Viceroy´s loss of legitimacy, which in turn contributed to the loss of the viceroyalty.
