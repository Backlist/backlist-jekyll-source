      Mintz’s book is where culinary microhistory started, but his take on sugar is so much more than that. Mintz managed to tackle questions about production, consumption, Caribbean slavery, and the English working class. His training as an anthropologist also made him more attentive to the symbolic meanings of sugar in addition to the practical ones, and historians have had to follow suit since then. This book is also important because it implicitly argues against the idea that food brings people together; by writing a book about the violence of sugar production, Mintz set food studies scholars down the path of asking big questions about food’s relationship with power.
