      McChesney’s work is an eloquent classic and still the best introduction to Central Asia before the modern era, focusing on questions like the Mongol political legacy and Islamic institutions, especially shrines. Although its tiny print run makes it an expensive purchase, it’ll give you a reason to visit your local library!
