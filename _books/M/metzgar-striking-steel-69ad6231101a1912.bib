      Metzgar’s father was a U.S. Steel shop steward in the 1950s, and in this incredible book, he combines a thought-piece of what it meant to be a unionist during the nation’s peak period of union density, a mourning of the loss of working-class solidarity, and an excellent history of the 1959 steel strike. Powerful stuff.
