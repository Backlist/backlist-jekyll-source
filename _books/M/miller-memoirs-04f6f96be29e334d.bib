      William Miller was a young English officer when he followed José de San Martín in his patriotic endeavors throughout Chile and Peru. He fought in the wars of independence, becoming a hero in several of the most important battles in both Chile and Peru. His brother John wrote a rich and colorful description of places, people, and events Miller witnessed, that to this day constitutes one of the most significant English-language accounts of the wars of independence in Latin America.
