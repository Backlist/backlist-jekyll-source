      Jeff Wasserstrom has already recommended Susan Mann’s _Talented Women of the Zhang_ in his [list on the history of modern China](http://backlist.cc/lists/the-history-of-modern-china). It’s too wonderful not to mention again, particularly in the context of thinking about family and gender, as it traces—and in some cases, imagines, on the basis of unimpeachable historical scholarship—the lives of three generations of elite women in the nineteenth century. But readers might also find interesting Mann’s textbook, _Gender and Sexuality in Modern Chinese History_. This overview is a solid introduction to recent topics and scholarship in the field and, like everything Mann writes, is a pleasure to read.
