      Bryan McCann’s historical tour of how samba came to be does not treat the music in the usual romantic way, as an art form hermetically sealed from the rest of the world. Instead, this book shows us how recording studios, radio stations and the government of populist dictator Getúlio Vargas all helped shape samba to become Brazil’s national music. Replete with stories about musicians and their lives, _Hello, Hello Brazil_ shows that music, business and political interests created an art form that has become synonymous with Brazil itself.
