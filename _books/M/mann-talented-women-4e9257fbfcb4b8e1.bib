      An elegantly crafted work that brings to life in imaginative and convincing ways the experiences of a group of interrelated women belonging to three generations of a highly literate family. Enriched by close study of the poetry of the protagonists, whose writings reveal an interest in ideas and relationships that challenges standard ideas of cloistered women with worldviews as limited as their movements, it asks us to think about how differently Chinaâ€™s eventful nineteenth century looks when viewed from the perspective of intellectually curious elite women.
