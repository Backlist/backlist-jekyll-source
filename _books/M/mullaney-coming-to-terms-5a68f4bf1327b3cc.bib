      This book explores the way that the Communist Party used censuses and then reports by teams of ethnographers to decide just how many “ethnic minorities” the diverse country they took control of in 1949 should be described as containing. A short work inspired by ideas from science studies, as well as archival digging; a model of historical investigation in a problem-solving mode.
