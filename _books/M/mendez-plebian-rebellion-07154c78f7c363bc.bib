      By studying a local royalist revolt in Huanta in the aftermath of independence, Méndez argues that Peruvian peasantry successfully pushed its own political agenda upon regional elites not only during the revolt but also throughout the whole process of independence. Méndez complicates our definition of concepts like patriotism, liberalism, and citizenship by showing that indigenous groups held a political vision that was distinct from that of the colonial regime and the republic that followed it. Indigenous peoples forged and fought for this distinctive Andean political culture, creating a space for themselves in the political arena of nineteenth century Peru.
