      McCartin provides an expert history of how Reagan destroyed the air traffic controllers when they struck in 1981, ushering in a new era of union-busting that continues today. Yet McCartin also details how the path toward that disastrous strike was one of workers taking over their own union and making radical demands for respect from the government.
