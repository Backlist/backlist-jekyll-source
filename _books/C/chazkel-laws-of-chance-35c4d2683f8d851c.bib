      _Jogo do bicho_ (animal game) is an extremely popular underground lottery in Brazil that uses animals as the betting numbers. Going back to its origins in the late nineteenth century as a raffle to promote a zoo, Amy Chazkel shows us how the game grew into a clandestine lottery of its own when, was criminalized by the government, even if mostly tolerated on the streets, where police often looked the other way for a bribe. This fascinating look at the repression, acceptance and popular culture surrounding this Brazilian phenomenon suggests that in Brazil, written law is very far from everyday life in the streets.
