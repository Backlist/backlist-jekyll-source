      A collection of essays about modernity in India, these were the articles and chapters left over after Chakrabarty published his well-known book, [_Provincializing Europe_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0691130019/ref=nosim/clionautics-20), which challenged us all to think of the ways we might write history from a non-European perspective.  Habitations is an extended set of ruminations on what such a history might look like as Chakrabarty considers the role of garbage, compassion, pity, and the law in comprehending the vexed genealogy of modernity in India as its features were produced by colonialism.
