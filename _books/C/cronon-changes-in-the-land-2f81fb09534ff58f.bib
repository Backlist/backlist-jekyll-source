      This is one of those books that’s not explicitly about food, but Cronon’s focus on environmental history and on contact between English colonists and Native Americans yields lots of commentary on changing crops, domesticated animal use, and by inference, eating habits. The book (which started as a paper that Cronon wrote while in graduate school—and who doesn’t like to aspire to the idea that your grad school term papers can become your first book?) combines scientific data like pollen counts with textual sources to explore the effect of European colonization on New England’s plants and peoples.
