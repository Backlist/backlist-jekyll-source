      Chambers presents a vivid depiction of political culture in southern Peru before and after independence. Using a lens of gender and class relations, the author analyzes how elites and popular classes played a significant role in the creation of political liberalism at the expense of gender relations. The construction of men´s public reputation had an oppressive effect in Peruvian women´s lives by defining female virtue as a private issue of morality, effectively excluding them from politics.
