      This book argues museums were once among the most important sites producing knowledge—especially object oriented knowledge—or as Conn describes it, “object based epistemology.” Between about the 1870s and 1930s, museums in the United States were home to some of the nation’s top researchers and scientific minds, who were supported in fieldwork, writing, and opportunities to collect new specimens. Over time, as Conn demonstrates, many intellectual concerns and top minds thinking about them began to shift to university campus, like the renowned anthropologist Franz Boas, who moved from the American Museum of Natural History to Columbia University early in the twentieth century.
