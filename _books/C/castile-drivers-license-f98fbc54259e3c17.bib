      Castile combines her own testimony with the study of the driver’s license in the U.S. to offer an original and powerful reflection on Americans’ personal connections with this document, which also serves as a _de facto_ national ID card. The book covers several aspects of this artifact, from the time of its manufacturing, to the circulation of fake licenses.
