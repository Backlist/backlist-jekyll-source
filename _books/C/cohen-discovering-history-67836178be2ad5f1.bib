      Valuable for the treasure trove of thoughtful, critical summaries of Cold War publications it contains, this book also makes a compelling case for what the author describes as “China-centered” work on the Chinese past. Prior work tried to force Chinese experience into pre-set molds and overstated the significance of foreign influences.Cohen celebrates the shift—underway in 1984, much more developed by 2010—toward approaches that burrow into local settings and figure out what motivated Chinese actors.
