      In this book, we are reminded of the gifted historian we lost in the late Stephanie Camp. Bringing theoretical rigor and an inventive reading of evidence to bear in a relatively brief work, Camp opens entirely new vistas for thinking about the resistance of enslaved people to their bondage, and specifically to the ways enslaved women pushed back against captivity. By asking readers to think especially about the significance of physical space to the lives enslaved people made for themselves, Camp presents actions that might appear fleeting or insignificant at first glance as acts of defiance that will never again look the same to students of slavery.
