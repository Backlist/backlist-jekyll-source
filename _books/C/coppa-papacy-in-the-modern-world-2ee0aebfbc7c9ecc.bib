      This is a great textbook for beginners, accessible, concise, and up-to-date. The author focuses on the difficult relations between the papacy and the modern regimes created in the wake of the French Revolution, and therefore explores in depth the causes and effects of the Italian assault on the Papal States, the fortress mentality that shaped the popesâ€™ relationship with the totalitarian powers of the twentieth century, and the difficult transition from an overly-defensive to a more open and truly global papacy after the Second Vatican Council.
