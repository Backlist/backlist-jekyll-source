      _Culpeper's Complete Herbal_, first published in the seventeenth century, is one of the all-time classics of herbal medicine. Known for his unusual classificatory scheme, which grouped medical drugs according to their supposed astrological configurations, Culpeper's book is a treasure trove of centuries’ worth of amassed knowledge of European _materia medica_.
