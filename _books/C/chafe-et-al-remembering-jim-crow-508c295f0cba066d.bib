      The first time I heard Minnie Weston’s voice fade to a whisper as she hesitated to revisit painful memories about her brothers’ murders, I, too, held my breath and my eyes welled with tears. I was in the Duke University archives listening to her oral history preserved in the “[Behind the Veil](http://library.duke.edu/digitalcollections/behindtheveil/)” collection. Remembering Jim Crow curates excerpts from these powerful oral histories into chapters on bitter truths, heritage and memory, families and communities, lessons well learned, work, and resistance and political struggles. The book includes a CD of oral history excerpts.
