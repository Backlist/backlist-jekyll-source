      Published in 1995, Callowayâ€™s _The American Revolution in Indian Country_ remains both a pioneering study in the field of Early America as well as a call to arms. Through eight case studies, Calloway weaves together the history of the American Revolution with histories of Native peoples from the period, bearing witness to their interconnectedness despite the then-common tendency to separate the two. It is a great place to start for those interested in the role of Native peoples in the shaping, execution, and consequences of the revolution.
