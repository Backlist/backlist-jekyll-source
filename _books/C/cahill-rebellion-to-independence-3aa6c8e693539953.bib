      This collection of essays reflects more than twenty years of Cahill´s excellent work in the late colonial era. The topics covered range from political identities, race and ethnic relations, to political violence and rebellion. The essays together show the crucial political role that priests played in local Andean communities, as well as the political dynamism of local indigenous elites. Most provocatively, the essays show how many of these communities enjoyed considerable political autonomy under the Crown—thereby questioning our unexamined ideas of Spanish domination in Peru, and the causes of independence.
