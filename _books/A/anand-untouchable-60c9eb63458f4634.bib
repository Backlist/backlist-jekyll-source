      A deeply moving account of a day in the life of Bakha, a young street-sweeper in India in the 1930s.  As he goes about his day, we learn of his aspirations for a better life, one that seems within his grasp. His dream is challenged in a moment rich with social tragedy, when an unfortunate encounter on the street draws his attention to the intractability of caste distinctions in daily life.
