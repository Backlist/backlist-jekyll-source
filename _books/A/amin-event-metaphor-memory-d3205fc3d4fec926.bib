    text: In this elegant and slender book, Amin re-examines a well-known event the history of India’s nationalist struggle and retells it from the perspective of local inhabitants who lived through it and how these accounts conflicted with the nationalist version.  The killing of four Indian police officers in Chauri Chaura in February 1922  suspended Gandhi’s first major nonviolent campaign and made Chauri Chaura synonymous with violence and a lack of political discipline; Amin raises questions about the “lesson” of Chauri Chaura and how these lessons obscure the polysemous nature of history.
