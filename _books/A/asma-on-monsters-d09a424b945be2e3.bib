    text: "Stephen Asma’s _On Monsters_ (2009) is my personal favorite work of monster scholarship. It is one of those books that leaves you in awe of the author’s ability to write prose of absolute clarity about extremely challenging theoretical issues. The book ranges all over world history but never dizzies the reader, moving rather seamlessly from discussions of the role of evolutionary biology in our fear of monsters, to the author’s own experiences of terror, to Freud’s theory of the uncanny and on to contemporary obsessions with zombies and untrammeled technology."
