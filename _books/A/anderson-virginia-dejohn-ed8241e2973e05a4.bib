      This is an animal history, not a food history, but I think it’s crucial to think about such histories as ways of thinking about food and eating because the line between animals and meat is sometimes fuzzier than we think it is—especially during the colonial period. Today cows and pigs become “beef” and “pork” once they are dead, thus linguistically distinguishing live animals from edible meat. During the eighteenth century when people stole cattle, or listed them as necessary treaty articles, they referred to them as “beeves” or “beef cattle.” Battles over animals are the focus of Anderson’s book. She argues that after seventeenth-century English colonists introduced cattle and pigs to New England and the Chesapeake, Indians reacted to these animals in different ways. Sometimes animals, because they were not fenced in, preceded colonists’ imperial expansion (so Indians maimed them as a new type of violence). Sometimes they were status symbols for Indians interested in new forms of property (so they accumulated them for redistribution). Only sometimes were they just meat.
