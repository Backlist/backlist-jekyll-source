      Anna’s thorough account explains the extended survival of the Spanish crown in Peru, showing how independence was not an obvious or even a desired choice. It was only the viceroyalty’s economic decline that forced the elite to consider independence as a way to save what was left of their political power. By not delving enough into the reasons why the popular masses might have supported independence, Anna reinforces the “independence conceded” narrative, but this remains the most comprehensive account of the war of independence in Peru available in English to date.
