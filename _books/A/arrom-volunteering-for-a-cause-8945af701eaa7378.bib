      The mid-nineteenth century _Reforma_ dealt a serious blow to the Catholic Church, appropriating clerical wealth and severely restricting the Church’s jurisdiction. Catholic laymen and especially laywomen took up the slack, forming an array of voluntary devotional and charitable associations to revive the faith. If they opposed secularization efforts and liberalism more broadly, pious volunteers nevertheless heralded a new kind of Catholic civil society and forged new social roles for Catholic women. Silvia Arrom’s book reconstructs the history of Mexico’s most influential lay voluntary association, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. It demonstrates how these “forgotten pioneers of social welfare” helped prepare the ground for the Social Catholicism of the late-nineteenth century and ultimately for the confessional politics of the Partido Católico Nacional.
