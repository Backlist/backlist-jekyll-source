      Although not as well-known as Aitmatov’s (significantly longer) novel _The Day Lasts More than a Hundred Years_, this sparse but lyric novella depicts rural Kyrgyz culture bending under the weight of World War II as forbidden love breaks out between the child narrator’s sister-in-law and a decommissioned soldier. Equally Kyrgyz and Soviet, the region’s most acclaimed novelist embodies modern Central Asia’s conflicted relationship with its Soviet past, whose achievements and great violence often run in the same current.
