      Today, one fourth of the world’s population resides in a country that borders the Bay of Bengal. In this page-turning book, Sunil Amrith traces the cultural, economic, and environmental history of this dynamic maritime region. For centuries, the Bay acted as a “maritime corridor” connecting ethnic Malays, Tamil Muslims, as well as Chettiar, Sindhi, and Gujarati merchants. Focusing on the circular migrations around the Bay, Amrith narrates a long-forgotten history of this region’s interconnectedness—one that historians have overlooked with the redrawing of national boundaries in the postcolonial era.
