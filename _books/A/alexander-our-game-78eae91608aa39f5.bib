      Surveys of baseball history tend to be either too anecdotal, too detailed, or too long. Alexander gets the balance right in _Our Game_, providing a one-volume history that establishes a solid framework for understanding how, when, and why the game and the business of baseball changed from the 1840s through the 1980s.
