    text: 'The ability of monsters to illuminate vast regions of human experience can be found in books like Timothy K. Beal’s _Religion and Its Monsters_ (2001). Beal examines some of humanity’s original monster stories in the Ancient Near East and introduces us to some of the basic intellectual problems raised by the emergence of monotheism, problems that monsters (and _Yahweh_’s relationship to them) helped palliate, if not resolve. You’d expect such cerebral fireworks to come in a rather leaden tome but that’s not at all the case. H.P. Lovecraft, the _Hellraiser_ film series and even the band GWAR receive as thoughtful a treatment as the _Enuma Elish_ and the _Book of Job_.'
