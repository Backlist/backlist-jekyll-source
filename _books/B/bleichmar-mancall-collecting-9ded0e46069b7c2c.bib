      Many books proclaiming to be about the early history of museums are confined mainly to the story of “Cabinets of Curiosity,” or _wunderkammern_. While laying important groundwork for later museums, the early passion for collecting influenced any number of emergent disciplines from art to anthropology and geology to biology. In a series of fourteen essays, the editors of this volume bring together historians, art historians, and historians of science to offer richer context for early collecting in the Atlantic world, showing, for example, how Native Americans came to value certain European produced goods while other goods became more popular in Java. Trade and value as a cross-cultural concept were critical in shaping early collections.
