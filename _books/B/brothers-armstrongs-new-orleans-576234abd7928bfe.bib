      Brothers’ excavation of _fin-de-siècle_ New Orleans places NOLA next to Vienna and Paris as central sites for the birth of twentieth century modernism. It tells the story of Louis Armstrong and the origins of jazz through the layers underlying “one musician’s experience of a complex city”: the sanctified churches, the urban rag-pickers, the culture of masculinity amongst musicians, the hardening definition of race in Louisiana after _Plessy vs. Ferguson_, and the complex dynamics between _gens de colour_ and uptown African Americans from the countryside.
