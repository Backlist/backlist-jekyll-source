      Gaiutra Bahadur undertakes an extraordinary journey from United States to Guyana to India to excavate the story of her great-grandmother—who sailed from the Indian subcontinent to the West Indies as one of countless indentured laborers sent to work in the sugar plantations across the British Empire. In order to promote “stability” in these tropical colonies, a quota system was implemented to recruit more Indian female “coolies.” Who were these women and what were their new lives like thousands of miles away from home? This is a highly original and deeply moving story of survival, highlighting the gendered dimensions of colonial labor migrations across the Indian Ocean.
