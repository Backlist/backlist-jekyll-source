      In the late 1920s, scores of peasants, rancheros (mestizo small-holders), and middle-class Catholic activists in central-western Mexico confronted the radically anticlerical government of Plutarco Elías Calles and its mobilized peasant allies or _agraristas_ (revolutionary agrarians) in the brutal Cristero war. Butler shows that earlier studies erred in reducing the conflict to a struggle over revolutionary land reform and treating religious belief as homogeneous or besides the point. By comparing four Michoacán communities and mapping their varying responses to the revolutionary state onto Michoacán’s fragmented “religious topography,” Butler’s book reveals that peasant political identities were rooted in specific, and often divergent, religious traditions.
