      Bohstedtâ€™s book is impressive in two respects: its ability to quantify and locate patterns in crowd protests about hunger, and its revision of the term moral economy. The idea of the moral economy was coined by the historian E. P. Thompson in 1971, and illustrated how, during times of scarcity, common folk in the early modern period stopped accepting inequalities of power and wealth to pressure wealthy men into guaranteeing access to food at a just price. Bohstedt thinks that a market economy was more important than the moral economy, and argues that people protesting hunger were acting out against the abuse of the market. His study of food rioters suggests the political motivations behind crowd action, but it also separates out the different types of food riots people participated in, and tracks how these behaviors changed over time.
