      Burnett’s story of the British exploration of Guyana in a fruitless search for the riches of El Dorado captures the key role of myths in colonial map-making. Read this after Paul Carter, and watch Burnett masterfully build on _The Road to Botany Bay_, adding another level of human complexity to Carter’s conclusions about space and imagination.
