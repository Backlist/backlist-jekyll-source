      This science fiction novel tells the story of a black woman mysteriously transported back in time to the antebellum South. There, she must live enslaved and protect a cruel slaveholder to ensure her survival in the present. Though imagining the past in a way radically different from Faulkner, Butler too speaks to the often destructive intertwining of black and white under slavery.
