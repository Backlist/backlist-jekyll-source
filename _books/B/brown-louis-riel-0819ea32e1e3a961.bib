      Focusing on the years between the Red River Rebellion in 1869 and Louis Riel’s execution for treason in 1885, this book chronicles tensions between Canada’s nascent government and its Métis peoples.  Although _Louis Riel_ boasts an impressive scholarly apparatus, the book is not entirely reliable as a work of history; Brown spends a great deal of time considering the possibility that his subject was mentally ill, lending his work a phantasmagorical quality.  Still, it’s an impressive recounting of a story that isn’t nearly as well known in the United States as it should be.
