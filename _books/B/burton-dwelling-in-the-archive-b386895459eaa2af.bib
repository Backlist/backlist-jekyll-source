    text: >
       A thought-provoking volume about the nature of archives and what historians consider historical evidence, this book compels us to examine women’s memoirs as a site for producing historical accounts.  Through an analysis of texts written by three women in late colonial India, Burton demonstrates how accounts of home and households, with their rich description of intimate life and domestic space, can and should be integrated into what counts as “history.”
