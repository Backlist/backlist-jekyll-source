      Simultaneously a collection of oral histories and a historical account of the loss suffered by the author’s mother who left Lahore to move to Delhi in 1947, this book uses personal memoir and oral interviews to show the ways that partition was more than a national event.  In Butalia’s account, lives were unsettled, households broken up, and families separated; these processes transformed each of the figures she interviews. As she narrates their experience amid her own, we learn just how profoundly the event we know as partition generated many transformations.
