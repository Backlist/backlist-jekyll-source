      It’s hard to know what to say about a memoir that recounts the author’s childhood friendship with one of the most notorious serial killers in history. _My Friend Dahmer_ is every bit as harrowing as you’d expect. But what you might find surprising is that Backderf manages to make Dahmer seem human while still acknowledging that he was a monster. The book is also an unsparing portrait of growing up in the Midwestern suburbs during the 1970s. Once I started reading, I couldn’t put the book down. But I’m not entirely comfortable telling others to pick it up.
