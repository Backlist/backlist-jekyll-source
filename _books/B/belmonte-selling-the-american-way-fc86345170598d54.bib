      Not all of the U.S. cultural programs were secret. Belmonte’s _Selling the American Way_ focuses on the U.S. State Department’s “information”—aka, propaganda—campaigns, many of which focused on the accomplishments of “regular Americans.” As a more scholarly book than either _The Mighty Wurlitzer_ or _The Cultural Cold War_, the notes in _Selling the American Way_ double as an introduction to the field.
