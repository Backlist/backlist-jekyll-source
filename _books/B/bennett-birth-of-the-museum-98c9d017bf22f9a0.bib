      An invaluable resource for anyone starting to explore the history of museums, Bennett guides the reader through the history of museums from their earliest iterations in Europe to the more modern theoretical challenges facing museums. Embarking from the theorizations of Michel Foucault, Bennett shows how museums work to entrench certain cultural and social behavioral norms, and how large fair exhibits helped develop “exhibition cultures” and practices for display.
