      Using the framework of “generations” to understand slavery’s temporal evolution and its geographical variation, Ira Berlin traces how and why the experiences of enslaved people changed over the course of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries. Without losing a sense of slavery’s complexity, Berlin shows how enslaved people went from living in a wide range of slave regimes sprawled across mainland North America during the colonial era to living in an expansive plantation society concentrated in the South in the decades that followed the American Revolution. A more expansive and detailed, though more chronologically limited, version of Berlin’s argument can be found in an earlier work, _Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America_.
