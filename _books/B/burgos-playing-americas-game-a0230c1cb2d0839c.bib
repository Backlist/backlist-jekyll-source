      The history of Latinos in American baseball has been understudied and oversimplified, but Burgos offers a valuable corrective in _Playing America’s Game_. He moves the discussion of race in baseball beyond black and white to include “brown, red, [and] yellow” and expands the focus of his study past the major leagues and the United States to examine a multi-racial professional circuit that extended into the Caribbean. The resulting book incorporates baseball into a broader consideration of the cultural and social histories of race, ethnicity, and masculinity in Pan-American cultures of the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
