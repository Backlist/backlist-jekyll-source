    text: 'Kyle William Bishop has written the definitive literary, cinematic, and historical study of zombies with _American Zombie Gothic: The Rise and Fall (and Rise) of the Walking Dead in Popular Culture_ (2010).  Bishop places the modern zombie genre, the magical, Afro-Caribbean zombie, and the more familiar zombie created by George Romero in 1968 in _Night of the Living Dead_ within the category of gothic fictions. Published in 2010, Bishop’s work continues to have powerful resonance since he correctly predicted that “the zombedie” (zombies used both for comedic purposes and social criticism) and more general contagion narratives would grow in popularity and influence with an American public obsessed with zombie fictions.'
