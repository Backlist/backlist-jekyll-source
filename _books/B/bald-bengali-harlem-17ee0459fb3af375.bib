      _Bengali Harlem_ offers a vivid account of South Asian migrants who came to the United States between 1890s and 1940s. During this era, many Muslim peddlers and Indian seamen constructed a clandestine migration network across the country. Many of these men married Puerto-Rican and African American women, integrating into communities across the US, from New Orleans to Harlem. Bald tells a largely forgotten tale of early South Asian migrations to the United States. (Keep an eye out for Bald’s documentary, “In Search of Bengali Harlem,” which is currently in production.)
