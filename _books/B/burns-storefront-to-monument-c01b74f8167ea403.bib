      In 2016, the Smithsonian Institution will open the National Museum of African American History and Culture. African Americans have long been active agents in responding to and shaping how their stories are presented in public, however. In this innovative book, Burns traces the origins of black museum culture back to the 1960s and 1970s, when the Civil Rights Movement influenced a host of fresh museums concentrating on African American History and culture, including the DuSable Museum of African American History in Chicago, the International Afro-American Museum in Detroit, the Smithsonianâ€™s Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, and the African American Museum in Philadelphia.
