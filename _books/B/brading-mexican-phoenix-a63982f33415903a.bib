    text: >
      The Virgin of Guadalupe is Mexico’s most visible and potent religious icon, and so deeply is the cult entangled with the country’s identity that the term “Guadalupano/a” can be another name for “Mexican.” There are thousands of books about Guadalupe, but Brading’s centuries-spanning theological and intellectual history shows how successive generations of acolytes and skeptics forged, debated, and transformed the Dark Virgin of Tepeyac and continuously remade Mexico in the process.
