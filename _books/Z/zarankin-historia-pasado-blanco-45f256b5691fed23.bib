      Some of the most interesting work on the nineteenth century history of Antarctica is currently being done by a team of Argentine and Brazilian historical archeologists working in the South Shetland Islands in the Antarctic Peninsula region.  _Historias de un pasada en blanco_ is part of an ongoing effort to “voice the silences” in Antarctic history through a focus on the experience of sealers working in the region (a group that left few written documents). Through innovative archeological research they show how sealers worked in tremendously difficult conditions to incorporate this part of Antarctica into the expanding capitalist world of the early nineteenth century in ways that were longer lived and more nuanced than traditional boom-bust narratives suggest.
