      A Studs Terkel-like collection of interviews with individuals from many walks of life who offer unvarnished and opinionated accounts of their experiences: everything from working in brothels to writing code; from challenging to gaming corrupt systems; from creating art to making trouble. Some chapters are moving; some amusing; many unsettle common assumptions. Translated in a lively, effective way by a leading Australian cultural historian.
