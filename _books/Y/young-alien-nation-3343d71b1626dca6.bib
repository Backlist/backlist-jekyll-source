      Moving beyond nation-based histories of migration, Elliot Young tracks Chinese migrations in the Americas over the span of a century. _Alien Nation_ explores how Chinese migrants were depicted as aliens—politically, socially, and sexually—across the Americas in different ways; it also tells the story of how the Chinese diaspora constructed its own alternative community. Adopting a “hemispheric” approach, Young argues that there were more continuities than differences between the experiences of “coolies” in Latin America and the “free” labor migrants in the United States and Canada.
