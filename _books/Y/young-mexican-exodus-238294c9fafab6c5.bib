      Julia Young’s excellent new book reframes the Cristero War as a transnational event, shifting our attention to the thousands of Mexican émigrés who participated in the conflict from various locations in the United States. The religious conflict of the 1920s created a veritable “Cristero diaspora” in the US, among whose numbers were exiled priests and nuns, middle-class activists, and even members of the clerical hierarchy. In their new communities in San Antonio, Los Angeles, and Chicago, Cristero immigrants formed transnational associations, staged marches and acts of spiritual solidarity, planned border rebellions, and ultimately recreated the religious conflict raging back home. Cristiada-related displacement also shaped Mexican American religion, most importantly in the cult of Saint Toribio Romo, a Cristero martyr and patron saint of migrants and border-crossers.
