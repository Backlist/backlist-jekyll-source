      This marvelous book will drop you into the late 17th-century world of scientists, artists, experimenters, engineers, and architects whose hands helped to shape modern science. Largely focused on England and the Netherlands (Jardine’s areas of specialization), _Ingenious Pursuits_ makes dazzling connections between ideas and practices. Modern readers who think of the arts, humanities, and sciences as radically different intellectual enterprises may find that this book changes their mind. Jardine’s eye for fascinating detail and her gifts as a storyteller make for compulsive reading, and the cast of characters is at once familiar and revelatory.
