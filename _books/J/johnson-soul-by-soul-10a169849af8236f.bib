      Forcefully written and professedly “abolitionist” in its politics, Johnson’s _Soul by Soul_ examines the domestic slave market in New Orleans and portrays it as more horrifying and more complicated than a reader might imagine. Johnson finds prospective buyers looking for enslaved people on whom they could project fantasies of mastery, and people in showrooms and on the auction block trying to shape their self-presentation to make their circumstances the least awful they could. One of the earliest works in a recent wave of scholarship on the domestic slave trade, it is still one of the best.
