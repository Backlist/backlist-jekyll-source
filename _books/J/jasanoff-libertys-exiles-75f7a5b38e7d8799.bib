      Some of the most overlooked—or at least poorly understood—actors of the revolution are the Loyalists. Their “patriot” contemporaries habitually described them as traitors to both liberty and their fellow countrymen, while scholars have often treated them as a timeless, reactionary community which simply resisted the revolutionary changes of the period. In _Liberty’s Exiles_, however, Jasanoff restores much of their agency by underscoring the conscious thought and effort that went into their loyalism. More surprisingly, Jasanoff’s study presents its readers with Loyalist figures who ultimately do not look as different from their revolutionary counterparts as they may seem. Although choosing to remain British subjects, Loyalist refugees in all corners of the British Empire were some of the most vocal critics of imperial policy and drivers of political change.
