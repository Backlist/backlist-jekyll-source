      Like Goings, Jacobs’ story points to some of slavery’s most central dynamics. In particular, she demonstrates the unique travails of enslaved women, as Jacobs survived the harrowing harassment of her owner in North Carolina and risked her own life and the possibility that she would never see her children again to escape his clutches.
