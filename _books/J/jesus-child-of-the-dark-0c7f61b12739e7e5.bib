      This classic work is a translation of the diaries of Carolina Maria de Jesus, a self-taught writer living among the poor residents of a São Paulo _favela_ (slum). A journalist on the local news beat met Carolina in her neighborhood and helped her publish it the diary in 1960. It became the best-selling book in Brazilian publishing history at the time, was translated into English and gained international fame. That Carolina died in 1977 without a penny to her name speaks to Brazil’s persistent social inequality.
