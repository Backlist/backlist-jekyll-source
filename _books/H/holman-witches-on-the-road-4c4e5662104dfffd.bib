      Sheri Holman’s novel _Witches on the Road Tonight_ (2011) tells a set of terrible secrets.  Holman’s tale centers on the story of Eddie, a down-at-the heels old-fashioned TV horror host and the people he loves, harms, and ultimately destroys. Perhaps most meaningfully, Holman uses a tale of family horror mixed with just a drop of magical realism to explore the nature of fear and why we sometimes tell stories of monsters for reasons other than terror, catharsis, or entertainment.<br /><br />Holman’s work illustrates why the story of our culture’s monster tales bears so much weight. We’re looking at stories that are more than pop culture artifacts or embodiments of the quirky excesses of the human psyche. Monsters are coded structures of power, sometimes shape-shifting into energies of subversion and then, when we aren’t looking, turning back again. Cultural horrors are signposts, and sometimes, like the root meaning of the word ‘monster,’ they are warnings and portents: that we should be wary of the darkest part of the forest and the political, social, and economic structures that built the paths that lead us there.
