      Sarah Haley’s _No Mercy Here_ should compel us to see Jim Crow as not merely a racial caste system but a system of interlocking oppressions based on gender, labor, and race. She shows how incarcerated black women forced to work in the convict lease system and on chain gangs pushed back against racial capitalism and the patriarchy through what she calls “black feminist refusal.” With mass incarceration emerging as this generation’s civil rights issue, we should take a page from Haley and open our eyes to the experiences of incarcerated black women in our times. Only by seeing all the ways the criminal punishment system is oppressive and by recognizing all the people it oppresses can we dismantle the prison-industrial complex.
