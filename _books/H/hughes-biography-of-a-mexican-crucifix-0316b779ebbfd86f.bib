      Saints’ images are sites of divine presence in the physical world, and Mexican believers often approach their icons as living beings. Scheper Hughes provides a deeply human portrait of the Cristo Aparecido of Totolapan, an image of the crucified Christ that had appeared miraculously in that central Mexican community during the sixteenth century. Augustinian friars from Mexico City “kidnapped” the image shortly after his appearance, but the Cristo ultimately made his way back to Totolapan by way of the Reforma, which nationalized the Augustinian convent where he had been held. The image influenced the villagers’ engagement with the modern world—from liberalism to liberation theology—leading Scheper Hughes to argue that the Cristo himself should be considered a historical agent in Totolapan’s centuries-long drama.
