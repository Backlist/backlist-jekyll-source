      Labor history had (has?) a pretty serious race and gender problem, which is why reading Tera Hunter’s _To ‘Joy My Freedom_ comes as such a welcome relief. Hunter captures the nuances of what it meant to be an African American woman working as a domestic laborer in the post-emancipation South. She retraces their inner lives as members of families and communities, but also as workers who made demands of their employers and even organized a labor union to contest Jim Crow’s stunted vision of the meaning of freedom.
