      Three chapters of Hughes’ autobiography take place in the Soviet Union, one of which recounts his 1933 visit to Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, which serve as a foil to the segregated American South. Hughes visits collective farms on the Iranian border, gleefully recounts the discomforts of his erstwhile travel companion, Arthur Koestler, and ruminates on the comparative freedoms of Soviet Central Asians as opposed to American blacks. Hughes’ account provides a gateway to the growing scholarly field on socialist internationalism and the affinities between the Third World, the Soviet South, and African-Americans.
