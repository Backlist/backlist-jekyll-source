      One of the only true histories of the Smithsonian and Bureau of American Ethnology (BAE), this book provides background on the development of American anthropology on the institutional level. On a pragmatic level, the work of BAE fieldworkers—anthropologists, linguists, and ethnomusicologists among them—fed objects, papers, and artifacts into the rapidly collections at the Smithsonian. On an intellectual level, Frank Hamilton Cushing, John Peabody Harrington, and Frances Densmore all shaped their emerging fields through intense writing and publication while simultaneously shipping physical collections to Washington, D.C.
