      Liu Dapeng lived at the turn of the last century, a promising student from a downwardly mobile farming family who hoped he might pass the imperial exams and become an official—until, that is, the Qing Dynasty cancelled the exams and was then itself felled by rebellion. Unusual only in that he diligently kept a daily journal (which is largely extant) from the 1890s until his death in 1942, Liu provides a local, conservative view on a tumultuous time in China’s history. As she tells Liu’s story, Harrison also introduces the realities of cultural currency, family life, economic survival, and changing identities in the waning Qing and young Republic of China.
