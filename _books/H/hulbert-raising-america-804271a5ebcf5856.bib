      Another broad history, this one of American parenting advice in the twentieth century, amplifies some of the discussions in _Huck’s Raft_. Hulbert traces the influence of religion, psychology, and social science on American ideas about the proper shape of a good childhood. The sources Hulbert taps—infant-care manuals, government pamphlets, the famous Dr. Spock—are invaluable in revealing how concepts about childhood manifested themselves in pragmatic advice to those directly responsible for children’s care. _Raising America_, which is a trade book written by a journalist, is also very fun to read.
