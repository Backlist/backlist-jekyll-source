      For nearly fifty years, this has been one of the best narrative histories ever written, full stop. Richly synthesized, it begins with Cajamarca and goes into wonderful detail on the forty-year resistance led by Atahualpaâ€™s younger brother Manco and his sons, who tried to stay politically and religiously independent of Spanish rule.
