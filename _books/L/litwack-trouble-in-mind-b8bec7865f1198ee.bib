      Prepare yourself for a heavy heart; Leon Litwack’s social history of Jim Crow captures the ugliness of Jim Crow with an unrelenting intensity that will leave you emotionally spent. Litwack is masterful in his ability to weave together an incredible array of stories that are equal parts heart-wrenching and horrifying. However, this book ultimately tells an uplifting story—a story of African American resilience, fortitude, and ingenuity, a story of a people who refused to accept the terms of their oppression.
