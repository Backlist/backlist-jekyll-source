      Over 100,000 Chinese coolies arrived in Cuba to labor in colonial plantations and mines during the coolie trade in the nineteenth century. Some eventually married Cuban women and established new families on the Caribbean island; many fought in the Cuban War for Independence against Spain. In this beautifully written book, Kathleen Lopez traces the social history of Chinese Cubans from the mid-nineteenth century to the 1959 Cuban Revolution. _Chinese Cubans_ offers a vibrant narrative of the communities they built in Cuba and the ties they maintained with China across multiple generations.
