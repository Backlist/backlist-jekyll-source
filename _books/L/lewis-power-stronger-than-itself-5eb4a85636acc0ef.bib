      As a writer, Lewis is totally unique: an important scholar, a significant jazz musician, and a participant-observer in his subject matter (he has been a member of the Association for the Advancement of Creative Musicians since the early 1970s). More than just a profound scrambling of the “creator vs. critic” problem, _A Power Stronger than Itself_ also offers an essential portrait of one of the key social-musical organizations of the twentieth/twenty-first centuries while placing its musicians into the more global story of postwar Experimental Music.
