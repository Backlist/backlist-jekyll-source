      In this classic work in the history of ideas, Lovejoy outlined the persistent beliefs in an ordered world system, hierarchically arranged and filled with diversity at every level. These concepts lie at the heart of the early modern worldview, and provided a backdrop for every natural philosopher working at the time as well as their potential audience and clients. Remarkable for its clarity and erudition, _The Great Chain of Being_ is essential for those seeking to understand why the Scientific Revolution was both a period of great continuity as well as great change.
