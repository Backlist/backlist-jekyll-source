      The name of this book is misleading, since Lanctot focuses primarily on the Negro National League of the 1930s and 1940s. This narrower perspective allows him to provide deeply researched analysis that illuminates the successes and failures of Negro League baseball. Lanctot addresses the experiences of black players, umpires, and fans, but he particularly excels in explaining the business decisions made by executives within one of the largest predominantly black-owned industries in the Depression and World War II- era United States.
