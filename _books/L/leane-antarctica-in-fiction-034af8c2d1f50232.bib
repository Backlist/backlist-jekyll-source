      _Antarctica in Fiction_ offers both a literary history of Antarctica, and a critical analysis of the novels, poems, plays, and movies that have been written, performed, and produced about the southern continent.  Leane’s contributions to a “cultural turn” in Antarctic studies help to reveal that fiction has played an important, if underappreciated, role in shaping the continent’s history. Science fiction, for example, has been responsible at different times for helping to construct Antarctica as a place of limitless possibility (for example, George McIver’s _Neuroomia_), a place of existential foreboding (for example, H.P. Lovecraft’s _At the Mountains of Madness_ and John Campell’s _Who Goes There?_) and as a place of eco-terrorist conflict (for example, Kim Stanley Robinson’s _Antarctica_).
