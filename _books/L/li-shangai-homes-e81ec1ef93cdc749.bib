      This slim volume offers an evocative, gracefully written, and carefully researched reconstruction of the experiences of the inhabitants of two Shanghai alleyway homes. Concentrating mostly on the Mao years, this is both a scholarly and intensely personal work, since the author spent her childhood in Shanghai just after the period that is her focus, before moving abroad; her parents and grandparents lived in the homes in question; and she makes extensive use of interviews as well as archival materials and family photographs.
