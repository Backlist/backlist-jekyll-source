      So you’re determined to read about overland trade nevertheless? Then let Scott Levi be your guide, in a work that synthesizes his various monographs on Indian merchant networks throughout the region. The “Silk Road” in the title reflects his publisher’s hopes to sell books, not the author’s approach, which helps to challenge the old canard that the rise of European trade in the Indian Ocean killed overland trade and led to Central Asian isolation.
