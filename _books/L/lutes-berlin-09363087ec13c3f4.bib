      Lutes’s examination of late-Weimar Germany is shrouded by the horror of what’s to come but still manages not to descend into teleology.  The book takes seriously the small contingencies that mark histories of everyday life.  As with Sacco’s work, the pages can be overstuffed, but the storytelling is taut, the material powerful.
