      In her frank and poignant memoir, Shirley Lim – a feminist poet and literary scholar – documents her childhood experiences growing up in colonial Malacca and her subsequent journey to the United States. As the daughter of a Chinese merchant and a _peranakan_ mother, Lim paints a culturally diverse landscape of British Malaya and the rising ethnic tensions in the post-independence period. Rich in its historical detail and introspective insights, _Among the White Moon Faces_ will engage readers interested in 20th-century Southeast Asian history, as well as Asian American literature.
