      This hefty tome is an interdisciplinary anthology whose 106 essays and primary sources cover major historical periods as well as many societal phenomena. One can browse and read selections over time, gaining great insights into Brazilian history and culture. The primary source selections themselves are fantastic: confiscated letters of political dissidents, oral histories of favela residents, and fascinating photographic collections.
