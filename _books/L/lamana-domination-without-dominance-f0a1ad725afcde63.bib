      Never mind the jargon. This is an absolutely fascinating book on how Andean expectations shaped the conquest. It pulls apart the conquistadorsâ€™ contradictory accounts to show why military supremacy did not translate into cultural domination; why Incas ruled in Cusco for a quarter-century after 1532; and how Spaniards struggled to understand why war could only be waged on full moons.
