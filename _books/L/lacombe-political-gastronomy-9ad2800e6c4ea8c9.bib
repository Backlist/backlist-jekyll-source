      LaCombe is a master at negotiating between the practical implications of food and its symbolic connotations. I don’t think people really think about how hard it is to do this until they try to write about food themselves. In this monograph, LaCombe explores the food-related misunderstandings that occurred when Native Americans and European colonists came into contact with each other in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. He’s interested in asking questions about authority, representations of dependency, and humanism. He also has an excellent discussion of the first Thanksgiving.
