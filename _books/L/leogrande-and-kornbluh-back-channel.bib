      While most books on U.S.-Cuban relations focus on the hostile aspects, this one uncover the long history of secret bilateral attempts to repair the damaged relationship following the Cuban Revolution. Published mere weeks before Obama and Castro made their announcement of rapprochement, this book provides insight into the various obstacles that stymied previous efforts.
