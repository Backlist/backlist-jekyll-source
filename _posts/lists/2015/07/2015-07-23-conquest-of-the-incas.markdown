description: "To explain how the Spanish conquered the Incas, we must credit the alliances made with the many Indian groups discontented with Inca rule, as well as alliances made with Incas themselves, including Atahualpa. Those alliances then became the foundation of an incredible colonial society, surprisingly just, suddenly violent, that lasted for nearly three hundred years—almost twice as long as England’s colonies in North America."

On November 16, 1532, Francisco Pizarro and about 160 conquistadors captured an Inca lord named Atahualpa, killed over 2,000 Indian warriors, and conquered an empire that sprawled across the Andes Mountains of South America. The Spanish called that empire Peru. In the decades following, its silver transformed Spain from a crusader kingdom with pretensions of re-taking Jerusalem into history’s first global empire—all because of Pizarro’s sword, his _harquebusiers_, and a mystery illness that had laid Atahualpa’s father low. As you may have read: _Guns, Germs, and Steel_.

Or not. Historians bristle at such an easy version of the events that placed Peru under Spanish rule. The following eight books tell a different story, at once more exciting and more tragic. Their most important lesson is this: although European weapons and disease helped, that advantage diminished extraordinarily when ranked against the Inca empire’s size and logistical superiority. To explain how the Spanish dominated the Incas, historians instead credit the many Indian groups discontented with Inca rule, as well as alliances made with Incas themselves—including Atahualpa. Unlike Mexico, whose Aztecs were quickly conquered, Peru’s Incas were incorporated into the reformed kingdom only after decades of conflict and negotiation. Their incorporation then became the foundation of a surprising colonial society—unexpectedly just, immensely lucrative, suddenly violent—that lasted for nearly three hundred years, almost twice as long as England’s colonies in North America.

What emerges is a conquest that took forty years, not one; that killed almost all of Spain’s supposed victors long before it was over; that left the Inca royal family and their sacred cult of imperial dead intact longer than nearly any other New World polity; and that allowed Peru’s people to continue to hope for what Europeans—and their historians—long thought unthinkable: the return of the kingdom to its now-Christian indigenous lords.

The following books aren’t just about the defeat of the Incas. They are about the creation and survival of Peru.
