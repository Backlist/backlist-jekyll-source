Contemporary American attitudes about childhood are rife with paradox. We’re convinced that our children are overprotected (this is a sentiment that seems politics-proof, reaching across party lines), yet parents find it impossible to step back from the many protective measures put in place over the past century. (Who wants to be the first one on the block to let their kid walk to school alone?) Or how about this: we’re convinced that our children are overprotected, [yet 22 percent of American children live in families whose household incomes fall beneath the poverty level](http://www.nccp.org/topics/childpoverty.html). These children, as well as black kids like [Tamir Rice](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/expert-tamir-rice-did-not-reach-for-gun-countering-officers-claims/) (shot to death by police at age twelve), are denied the protections accorded their upper- and middle-class counterparts. What is “childhood innocence,” and who gets to benefit from it? 

Historians of childhood can offer crucial context, showing how children’s lives have changed over time. But the field of childhood studies, which blends a strong historical perspective with critical assessment of the evolution of attitudes and ideologies around childhood, is full of interesting theoretical approaches to the kinds of paradoxes above. 

Here are ten books that can help you figure out how we came to be so confused about childhood.
