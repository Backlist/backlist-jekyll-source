I took my first Chinese history class in the late 1970s, eager to learn how the country had been reshaped by the revolutions of 1911 and 1949 that had ended dynastic rule and brought the Communist Party to power, respectively. My interest was soon piqued by finding out that long before Sun Yat-sen and Mao Zedong, China had already witnessed many insurrections, some of which had ended in the establishment of new dynasties; whether history called a rebel leader a “bandit” or a “king,” the saying went, came down to whether you won. As someone whose fascination with history began with memorizing the names of English kings and queens during a pre-teen year spent in England and who had always been intrigued by revolutions, I was hooked.

Much about China and the way it is studied has changed since I took that class. The country has grown stronger, more globally entwined, more urban. And thanks to novel trends in the discipline and greater access to the Chinese mainland and previously unknown or off-limits materials, new questions are being asked about China’s modern period—defined broadly here as beginning with end of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).

There is still value, though, in many books published before China’s recent rise; the basic things that first interested me about Chinese history remain relevant. What was altered and what left untouched by the upheavals that either toppled or almost toppled ruling groups? Why has China’s development continued to be a story of surprising twists and turns, with the Communist Party’s staying power sometimes seeming as unexpected in its own way as the fall of past ruling groups were at the time? The country’s current rulers, like some past ones, are fond of saying there is a single unified “Chinese tradition” of reverence for hierarchy and tradition. How is it, then, that history reveals a culture with multiple strands, including ones that extol questioning received wisdoms and turning the world upside down?
