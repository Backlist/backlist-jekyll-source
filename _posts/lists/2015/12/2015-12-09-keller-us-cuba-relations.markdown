description: 'How did the United States and Cuba—two nations separated by a mere 90 miles of water—drift so far apart? Why has a country as small as Cuba played such an outsized role in U.S. foreign and domestic politics? Why do the heroes of the Cuban Revolution, by now either long dead or spending their retirement in tracksuits, still hold such power over the American imagination?'

How did the United States and Cuba—two nations separated by a mere 90 miles of water—drift so far apart? Why has a country as small as Cuba played such an outsized role in U.S. foreign and domestic politics? Why do the heroes of the Cuban Revolution, by now either long dead or spending their retirement in tracksuits, still hold such power over the American imagination?

The relationship between the United States and Cuba, with all its paradoxes, passion, and personalities, has been the subject of hundreds of books—so many that casual readers can feel as overwhelmed as a _balsero_ floating across the Florida Straits. To compile this short list, I made the tough choice to eliminate entire categories of books that also merit reading. I left aside the excellent biographies of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, John F. Kennedy, and José Martí, as well as the gripping analyses of single events like the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis, in favor of books that cover wider swaths of time or people.

The books that did make it on to the list share a number of traits. With the exception of Che Guevara’s guide to guerrilla warfare, all the books are by top scholars who have devoted years, if not lifetimes, to understanding Cuba and the United States. In addition, the books all combine in-depth research with engaging prose. Many of the authors on this list are not historians, but they all write with a deep appreciation for the importance of history.

Despite these common characteristics, the books on this list approach the subject of U.S.-Cuban relations in vastly different ways. Some focus more on Cuba, others focus more on the United States. Some concern themselves more with international relations, others with the domestic implications of U.S.-Cuban ties. Some look at national leaders, others look at everyday individuals. Some emphasize the ties that connect the two countries, others emphasize the conflicts that divide them.

But if there’s a common motif that emerges, especially in light of the two countries’ rapprochement in 2015, it is that Cuba and the United States can’t quit each other. For better _and_ worse, geography and history have brought the two nations together in numerous ways over the centuries. Taken together, these books reveal that no matter how widely their politics may diverge, the destinies of the United States and Cuba remain intimately linked.
