Here’s the thing:  I had never read a graphic book before I wrote one.  I’m being totally serious: no _Watchmen_, no _Ghost World_, not even _Maus_.  When I first admitted this to Jonathan Fetter-Vorm, my co-author on [_Battle Lines_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0809094746/ref=nosim/clionautics-20), he was incredulous.  But after I sent him the script for the first chapter of our book, he believed me.  It was entirely clear, he realized, that I had no clue what I was doing. The only charitable explanation for such incompetence was ignorance.  And so Jonathan decided to play Burgess Meredith to my Sylvester Stallone. He put me on a rigorous training program. I was supposed to consume titles that would transform me into a connoisseur, someone capable of discerning wheat from chaff.

So am I the right person to ask for a list of graphic books that people should consider reading? I honestly don’t know. You’ll have to judge for yourself. But please know that I selected the titles below not because they’re my favorites, but because I think, as you’ll see in my annotations, that they offer a useful window into a particular episode from the past, or perhaps a glimpse at how this sort of work can accomplish things that text-based histories can’t—especially how graphic books can rely on visual metaphors to drive unusually spare narrative strategies.
