description: "In recent years, the kind of objective truth-telling a professional history implies has been roundly contested by those who feel that elites should not be in charge of writing the history of a large and diverse population. The popular history of India is often told quite differently, and as scholars have attempted to bridge the gap between professional and popular history, many have paid more attention to non-elite and subaltern perspectives."

History is among the most violently contested academic subjects in modern Indian politics, which may sound surprising because many of us think of history as a set of settled “facts” that can be established by archival research.  Because of its growing size (India comprises nearly 18 percent of the world population) and its status as the “world’s largest democracy,” India’s history can be told from many perspectives that directly contradict one another.  Writing history is a democratic exercise in India.  Yet, in part because of India’s religious, ethnic, and linguistic diversity, developing a capacious and inclusive account of India’s history has long been the goal of academically trained professional historians.  In recent years, the kind of objective truth-telling a professional history implies has been roundly contested by those who feel that elites should not be in charge of writing the history of a large and diverse population. The popular history of India is often told quite differently, and as scholars have attempted to bridge the gap between professional and popular history, many have paid more attention to non-elite and subaltern perspectives.  

Many of these challenges to professional and academic historians emerges from the [work of the Subaltern Studies Collective](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0195052897/ref=nosim/clionautics-20), who were deeply influenced by postcolonial theory and figures such as Edward Said. The collective, which published the first volume of its journal in 1982, became an international sensation when the first subaltern studies reader was published in 1988.  Although the collective has disbanded, it nourished a field of scholarship that took peasants, workers, _dalits_, _adivasis_, women, Muslims and other marginal figures in the conventional landscape of Indian history and placed them at the center of historical experience and transformation.  

This list of recommended readings draws from writers who disagree about India’s history.  They all ask the question that political theorist Sunil Khilnani asked in _The Idea of India_ (1997), “who is an Indian?” and by extension, they consider what kind of common past Indians should share.
