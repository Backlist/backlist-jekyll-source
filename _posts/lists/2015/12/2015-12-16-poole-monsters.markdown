The history of culture is a history of stories. We can best understand a culture’s history by an exploration of what kinds of stories it tells and, perhaps more importantly, why it needs those stories.

My own study of monster tales, and horror narratives more generally, has its genesis in my nerdy affection for horror. I’m not alone.  It’s difficult not to argue that an increased interdisciplinary academic attention to monstrosity in its many forms emerged from our own culture’s obsession with such tales. Never has horror, from the big screen, to fiction, to some of our most popular TV shows, held American culture so firmly captive. 

But a quick survey of American history shows that monstrosity has been central to every period in American history, forming our political rhetoric, shaping ideas about identity, defining our institutions, and provoking wonder and terror at the world. Can we make sense of the professionalization of science in America without understanding that those debates took shape in the eighteenth century’s struggle between theology and science over the meaning of the fossils of the wooly mammoth or the nineteenth-century public’s obsession with the possible existence of sea serpents? The monstrous rhetoric surrounding the sectional crisis, emancipation, and the struggle for African American equality helps us comprehend the real American horror story of race. Slasher films proved both enormously popular with the public and much debated by scholars between the 1970s and the 1990s. Their appeal—and cultural divisions about that appeal—tell us about more than American attitudes toward gore on the big screen; they also reveal much about American ideas about feminism. In fact, internal divisions within second wave feminism over the interpretation of popular culture helped to create third wave feminism’s willingness to engage with and subvert the entertainment industry’s misogynistic structures.

Oddly, monsters have only recently begun to appear in American historiography, though other disciplines, and in fact other historiographical traditions, have given them much deserved attention. I found few places to start within my own field, especially in the study of modern America. So, I went on a monster hunt.
