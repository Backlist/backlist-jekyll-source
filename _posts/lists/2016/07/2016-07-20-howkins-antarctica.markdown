  Antarctica has the shortest human history of any continent on Earth. Despite its short human history and lack of indigenous population, the southern continent has a fascinating historiography. Traditionally, historical interest in Antarctica has focused on exploration, and in particular on the history of the so-called “heroic era” of the first two decades of the twentieth century, but more recent historiography has seen a growth in more critical studies of these expeditions, connections to imperialism and nationalism, and their scientific and literary outputs.

Antarctica has the shortest human history of any continent on Earth.  Although speculation about the existence of a large southern landmass can be traced back as far as the ancient Greeks, the first recorded sightings of continental Antarctica did not take place until the year 1820.  Some of the first explorers who sailed south took trinkets with them to give to the indigenous peoples they encountered.  But instead of local populations, all they found was cold, ice, and terrestrial landscapes that appeared completely devoid of life.  

The hostility of Antarctica’s environment has played a particularly explicit role in shaping its human history.  In the nineteenth century, sealers struggled in miserable conditions to wrest some kind of profit from Antarctica’s marine ecosystems at the cost of rapidly declining fur seal and elephant seal populations. Early in the twentieth century explorers flocked to Antarctica in an attempt to prove themselves against the worst conditions that nature could offer.  Around the same time, sovereignty claims began to be made upon Antarctica, often connected to a rise of the Antarctic whaling industry.  Since the signature of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 – which suspended sovereignty claims, and proclaimed Antarctica to be a “continent dedicated to peace and science” – the history has been dominated by scientists attracted by what can be learned about the global environment from the bottom of the world.    

Despite its short human history and lack of indigenous population, the southern continent has a fascinating historiography, which has expanded significantly over the past fifteen to twenty years.  Traditionally, historical interest in Antarctica has focused on exploration, and in particular on the history of the so-called “heroic era” of the first two decades of the twentieth century.  Much of the writing about the expeditions of men like Roald Amundsen, Robert Falcon Scott, and Ernest Shackleton falls into the category of “armchair exploration” and often includes little analysis of the motivations for these enterprises.  Although popular books on the history of exploration continue to be written, recent Antarctic historiography has seen a growth in more critical studies, which provide insights into the racial, class, and gender dynamics of these expeditions, the connections to imperialism and nationalism, and their scientific and literary outputs.  

The last few years have also seen a number of historians move beyond the heroic era to investigate less studied periods of Antarctic history.  Historical archeologists have been reevaluating the history of nineteenth century sealing in an effort to “voice the silences” of early Antarctic history.  Sovereignty claims and geopolitical disputes have been the focus of a number of recent studies, with ongoing debates over the causes and consequences of the 1959 Antarctic Treaty.  Rejecting the claim that “good science” triumphed over “bad politics” with the signature of the Antarctic Treaty, historians of science have begun to investigate the ongoing relationship between scientific research and political claims in the modern history of Antarctica.  In many of these recent studies, a trend has been to think of Antarctica as an interesting place for integrating different historical fields in ways that may usefully inform historical research in other parts of the world.
