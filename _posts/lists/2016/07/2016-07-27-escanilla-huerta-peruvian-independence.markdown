When Napoleon invaded Spain in 1808, it would have been hard to predict that single action’s effect upon Spanish America and Brazil. In a matter of years, the region’s main cities were in turmoil, several of them claiming different types of political autonomy. By the end of the 1810s only the viceregal capitals of New Spain and Peru remained loyal to the Spanish crown. In Peru, the viceroys who ruled in the name of the Bourbon king during those years fought to suppress rebellions emerging in both cities and countryside, transforming the viceroyalty into the royalist center of counterinsurgency in Spanish America. It would take an invasion from without, drafted in Rio de la Plata—modern-day Argentina—and organized in Chile, to set off the chain of events leading to the declaration of independence of Peru in July of 1821. The Peruvian war would stretch on for another three years, until the final defeat of the royalist army at the end of 1824.

For decades, historians have argued over the degree to which inhabitants of the viceroyalty of Peru really wanted their independence. For some, Peruvians had wanted their independence since the late eighteenth century. In this narrative, the massive rebellion of the Inca noble José Gabriel Condorcanqui (1738-1781), or Tupac Amaru II, was a precursor as well as a proof of that feeling. This narrative was validated during the nationalist military government of Velasco Alvarado with the publication between 1971 and 1975 of the _Colección del sesquicentenario de la Independencia_—a collection of eighty-six volumes of primary sources published to commemorate Peru’s 150th anniversary of independence, and to present the most accurate and irrefutable proof of that desire of independence. However, at the same time other historians—most famously, Heraclio Bonilla and Karen Spalding—argued that the invasion of a Chilean-Argentinian army proved that Peruvians had wanted to remain a viceroyalty of Spain. According to these historians, the _Limeño_ elite resisted the idea of independence over fears of the Andes’ indigenous population, while the indigenous population did not have any real interest in the conflict and was recruited by force by both patriots and royalists. In the end—went this argument—independence had not been achieved by Peruvians but had been conceded after outside pressure.

In recent years, historians have contested this either-or vision of the independence by arguing in favor of a process in which Independence was conceived by members of the elite and intellectuals, and negotiated by regional elites and indigenous communities. While some of the most important studies of this subject remain in Spanish—for example, [_Metáfora y realidad de la Independencia_](https://www.amazon.com/METAFORA-REALIDAD-INDEPENDENCIA-EN-PERU/dp/6034502152), [_La ciudad sumergida_](http://www.librosperuanos.com/libros/detalle/2893/La-ciudad-sumergida.-Aristocracia-y-plebe-1760-1830), and [_La Independencia del Perú_](http://www.iep.org.pe/fp_scont_1277_scont_4346.html)—the list presented here offers a sample of the most recent English-language historical production on the subject as well as some classics that are a must-read for anyone interested in this topic. Ultimately, the process that led to Peru’s independence represented an opportunity for many sectors of society to challenge colonial hierarchies. Those challenges persisted throughout the nineteenth century via a long cycle of political instability that colored Peru’s state-making process. Peru’s independence helps us understand not only Peruvian politics in the nineteenth century but also Peru as a nation today.
