We expect the papacy to prize tradition and permanence. As the longest-enduring institution in the Western world, it remains an absolute theocratic monarchy, whose main headquarters are located in an impressive medieval palace in Rome, and whose ruler is guarded by “Swiss Guards” dressed like Renaissance mercenaries. Up until the late eighteenth century the popes devoted most of their time watching over the affairs of a small kingdom in the center of the Italian peninsula, and, except for some momentous decisions, their infrequent pronouncements rarely affected the everyday lives of Catholics beyond Italy. Today the Pope is, for good and bad, the central point of reference in the Catholic Church: he is its main source of doctrinal guidance and the decisive voice in shaping the leadership of a religious organization present in the whole world. As Jesuit historian John W. O’Malley once claimed, the most salient fact of Catholic history in the last centuries is the “papalization” of Catholicism. 

How did this revolution happen?

Roughly speaking, historians divide the history of the modern papacy into three major periods. The first begins with the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1789 and the violent humiliation of popes Pius VI and Pius VII at the hands of Napoleon, and ends with the First Vatican Council and the proclamation of Rome as the capital of the Kingdom of Italy in 1870. It is largely a story of conflict and negotiation with successive anticlerical revolutions in Europe, whose final act was the demise of the so-called “temporal power of the popes.”

The second period encompasses the eighty-nine years between the closure of the First Vatican Council and the announcement of the Second in 1959. It was marked by the slow adaptation of the papacy to the loss of its States–which it only accepted after the Lateran Accords of 1929–and by the parallel fostering of initiatives aimed at centralizing authority in the worldwide Catholic Church. This was a period of reluctant modernization, in which popes kept condemning most cultural innovations of the modern world and yet presided over unprecedented and dramatic changes in Catholic culture. 

The third and current period would be the age of the Second Vatican Council, whose commendable _aggiornamento_ (updating) of Catholicism led to a new wave of clashes between the Church and our contemporary cultural revolutions. We find the drawing of new sides, between those who see the Council as the end of anti-modernist Catholic authoritarianism and those who deem it a rather confusing episode in an otherwise compact history of Catholic continuity.

Full of controversial issues, the history of the modern papacy is not an easy subject. Readers can fall into partisan literature of all sorts, not always backed up by adequate sources. While I can’t fall back on any sort of papal infallibility, the following ten readable works are, to my judgment, based on reliable evidence and meet high standards of academic rigor. I hope you also find them more enthralling than the infamous _Da Vinci Code_!
