Terms like “Silk Road” and “Great Game” have done a great service in attracting readers to Central Asian history. However, these phrases—both coined by outsiders—have done little to advance an understanding of the societies they describe, one implying an inert timelessness, the other merely a rocky theater for European imperial rivalry. And the emerging habit of adding “new” to these terms when describing contemporary politics and economics in the region suggests that modern writers are not doing any better.  

So how can we understand modern Central Asia on its own terms? 

The reigning and still undefeated champion of obscurity, modern Central Asian historiography has come into its own in the last decade. The region can be loosely defined as the five former Soviet -stans—Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan—plus China’s Xinjiang “Uyghur Autonomous Region,” though the best recent histories have emphasized transnational ties with neighbors Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, and India. Travelers’ accounts used to dominate the narrative in the West, freighted with Orientalist assumptions about local superstition, nomadic brutality, and Islamic fanaticism. Soviet-era travel and archival restrictions cloaked the region behind another curtain of mystique, which alternated between Soviet martyrdom and a supposedly latent pan-Turkic solidarity. Then came the good days of the 2000s, which might be closing as quickly as they opened, as today’s regimes have asserted new control over archival access, compelling historians to seek novel sources and approaches. 

The newest generation of Central Asian historians has crafted more sensitive narratives for the region’s modern history. At their finest they incorporate local voices to explore how Central Asian people have been players, not pawns, in fending off, responding to, and redefining the imperatives of tsarist and then Soviet transformation. In the process, they have helped to answer some of the most compelling questions of Soviet history: How was a Communist revolution made in a land with no proletariat? How did nations emerge where tribe, clan, and faith formed the traditional core of identity? How did Islam weather the successive rounds of attack and co-optation from a nominally atheistic state? And how will the region’s Soviet legacy color its relations with neighbors like Iran and Afghanistan after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the removal of closed borders?
