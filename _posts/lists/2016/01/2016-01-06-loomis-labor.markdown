American labor history is filled with iconic moments that have stuck in the imagination of activists, if not always the general public: the Homestead and Pullman strikes in the 1890s, the Triangle Fire of 1911, the martyrdom of labor organizers like Frank Little and Joe Hill, Martin Luther King dying supporting a labor struggle in Memphis in 1968. 

These are powerful stories, but labor history is much more than the story of big strikes and martyred activists. It’s a lot more than unions, too. It’s the story of workers throughout the country working in factories, fields, and homes. It’s paid and unpaid labor. Work is a human activity we almost all share—and if we do not share in it because we are unemployed, its absence is a big part of the story, too. The story of labor history is one of a tension between enslaved African labor and free white labor in the first two centuries after English colonization of North America, the stories of how a rapidly expanding capitalism oppressed both white and black workers in the post-Civil War period and their struggles for dignified lives. It’s the story of workers striking and dying for their rights in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 

American labor history is also the story of workers fighting and winning basic human rights when the government finally stopped suppressing unions during the New Deal. Unfortunately, those same workers often sought to deny those rights to Asian, black, or Latino workers. They also sought to keep women in lower-paid jobs or working without pay in the home whether they wanted to or not. During the late twentieth century, not only did workers of color and women workers rise up to demand equality both on and off the job, but corporations also discovered they could escape their union contracts by closing factories and moving, first to the South and then overseas. All workers are facing the aftermath of deindustrialization, capital mobility, and resultant attacks on unions in the present. 

The rise and fall of the American working class has led us to tell ourselves stories about the past to inspire us today. But American labor activists have often mythologized the past to no good end. Many of the books below seek to strip away the mythology so that we can learn from the past in order to craft a better labor movement in the present and future. Choosing ten books on American labor history is a hard task, but the selections below represent some of the best the field has to offer.
