meta_description: '10 recommended books on the history of the Catholic faith in Mexico from historian Brian Stauffer'
description: 'The books on this list help explain how an imported and imposed religion succeeded, despite attacks by the Mexican state over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, revealing how a diverse, internally fragmented faith was remarkably inclusive and responsive to local realities. The Catholicism portrayed here is historically dynamic, unlike the backwards and monolithic Church depicted by earlier scholars. The books included focus especially on the realm of belief and practice among ordinary people, acolytes of the brown-skinned Virgin of Guadalupe or the miraculous Christ of Chalma, to locate what Pope Francis has called Mexico’s religious “idiosyncrasy.”'

Before embarking on his Apostolic Visit to Mexico in February of 2016, Pope Francis said, in an interview, he would come “as a pilgrim, to look for something among the Mexican people. I come to seek the wealth of faith that you have.” The statement was notable for how it inverted our notions about the direction of religious influence between Europe and the Americas. If Spanish conquerors framed their sixteenth-century invasion of Mexico as a campaign to bring Christianity to Indians, the first Latin American head of the global Church came to Mexico in search of a faith that is rapidly on the decline in its former European homeland. The Church may be headquartered in Rome, but its heart is in places like Mexico, whose ninety-eight million believers make it the world’s second most Catholic nation, after Brazil.

That Mexican faith is no copy of its European parent religion. In the same February interview, Francis praised Mexican religious “idiosyncrasy.” That idiosyncrasy was forged over a long history associated with the pains of conquest and colonialism, but also with a Mexicanization that allowed Catholicism to withstand repeated institutional and religious crises associated with modernity and the break with Spain in 1821. The faith survived the _Reforma_, the liberal secularizing program spearheaded by lawyer and president Benito Juárez in the mid-nineteenth century; it weathered Church-state conflict after the Revolution of 1910; and it endured intense state persecution and the bloody Cristero conflict of the 1920s and 1930s. In our time, it has retained its pull on Mexican hearts and minds in the face of Protestant proselytizing, neoliberal social dislocation, and the trudging advance of secularization worldwide, and diasporic Mexican devotions are reshaping religious culture in the U,S.

The books on this list help explain how an imported and imposed religion succeeded, despite its attacks by the Mexican state over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The vast literature on the Mexican Church in the modern period is growing at an impressive clip, stimulated by the opening of ecclesiastical archives to secular historians in the 1990s. This list reveals how a diverse, internally fragmented faith was remarkably inclusive and responsive to local realities. The Catholicism portrayed here is historically dynamic, unlike the backwards and monolithic Church depicted by earlier scholars. The books included focus especially on the realm of belief and practice among ordinary people, for it is among ordinary Mexicans, acolytes of the brown-skinned Virgin of Guadalupe or the miraculous Christ of Chalma, that the pilgrim pope sought his devotional wealth.
