description: 'In some way or another, the authors included in this list grapple with the question: How free is free? They ask what it means for a nation that believes itself to be the model democracy to use lynching, segregation, convict leasing, disfranchisement, debt peonage, race riots, and racist caricatures to control black men and women after abolishing slavery. They also ask how Jim Crow disrupted the interior lives of African Americans who survived it.'

To write about Jim Crow is to write about broken promises, many of which remain broken. Lincoln called for “a new birth of freedom” in the Gettysburg Address, but the promise of a just and democratic nation emerging from the ruins of the Civil War collapsed into what Rayford Logan called “the nadir of American race relations” with the end of Reconstruction. And so, to write about Jim Crow is also to write about the meaning of freedom. In some way or another, the authors included below grapple with the question: How free is free? They ask what it means for a nation that believes itself to be _the_ model democracy to use lynching, segregation, convict leasing, disfranchisement, debt peonage, race riots, and racist caricatures to control black men and women after abolishing slavery. They also ask how Jim Crow disrupted the interior lives of African Americans who survived it.

To write about Jim Crow is to write about broken promises and the meaning of freedom. But, as a friend once gently chided me, despite the horrors, injustices, and indignities of Jim Crow, we must remember to “leave room for the sublime.” My friend warned against handing absolute power over to Jim Crow—to remember the spaces African Americans carved out for joy and love, laughter and hope, refusal and resistance—and then he walked me across his living room to a wedding portrait of his grandparents from the 1940s. The smiling faces, beaming, told a story, not just of survival and resilience, but of truly not caring what the white world thought of them. My memory of their faces all these years later is hazy, but I carry with me my friend’s point—their point, really. Jim Crow was unbelievably brutal and oppressive, but black lives then and now are not dictated wholly by the terms others impose from without. Rather, Jim Crow reveals as much, if not more, about white supremacy and the values of American “democracy” as it does black lives.
