Family and familial ties are at the heart of Chinese society and culture, and in reflection, historians have created a robust and thought-provoking body of work on family and gender in China. In compiling this list, I selected books that I might recommend to any thoughtful reader, not just historians and not just Asianists. While a few of the selections are older, I have not included much of the “classic” scholarship but instead chosen things that have largely been published in the past ten years or so and thus reflect the most recent developments in the field. 

In doing so, a few trends are apparent. Social history remains the bread-and-butter of scholarship on China. Because it was only in the late 1970s and 1980s that China scholars (especially those from the United States) were able to enter China and access archives, there remains a lot of spadework for historians to do in canvassing and understanding the archival record. This is particularly true as access to new archives and broader and freer access to previously limited sources (both oral and far-flung archival) have opened since the 1990s (though some of that access is again closing off, a reflection of the broader efforts to limit speech in China since the advent of Xi Jinping’s administration). Recent trends in the discipline toward frameworks like the history of emotion and history of the body are also making themselves felt (sometimes trends still break in Chinese historical studies a bit after they have hit other geographical fields), creating space for reassessments of some long-standing tropes about topics like foot binding. In addition, much of the scholarship remains focused on the Chinese heartland and its majority Han ethnic group. However, one of the most exciting and rapidly growing areas of research in Chinese history is the history of its borderlands (particularly Xinjiang), and so we may hope for new scholarship that engages questions of gender and family in those regions as that literature grows and issues beyond top-down structures of control and bottom-up insurrections and other political themes are joined by other sorts of analyses. 

Finally, my list contains several authors who are not professional historians. Chinese history is an adamantly interdisciplinary exercise where disciplinary boundaries are readily crossed. As a field, we regularly read and engage with anthropologists, literature scholars, journalists who cover China, and many others both inside and outside academia (in many graduate programs, these works are even standard entries on introductory historiography syllabi). 

One of the results of the field’s openness to new perspectives and approaches is that the histories of gender, women, and family are increasingly well integrated into Chinese history. This vibrant body of literature—of which this list just brushes the surface—points us toward a Chinese history where women and gender are not a tack-on that gets covered during one week of the semester but a persistent and vital part of what Chinese historians do.
