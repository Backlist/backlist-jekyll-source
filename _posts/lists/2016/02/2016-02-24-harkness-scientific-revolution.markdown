meta_description: '10 recommended books for reading the history of the Scientific Revolution from historian and novelist Deborah Harkness'
description: 'While most historians are happy to admit something happened to the study of nature between 1400 and 1700, we remain strangely unable to describe exactly what that something was. The maddening maze of qualifications and uncertainties that riddle our thinking and our prose led Steven Shapin to famously proclaim in his 1996 book, _The Scientific Revolution_, “There was no such thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it.” Here are ten more books about the Scientific Revolution—if indeed there is such a thing.'

Ask ten historians of science and medicine what they do and you will get ten different answers. For some historians, their field chronicles how geniuses moved mountains of ancient authority in an effort to articulate a new worldview—think Copernicus and his heliocentric theory, or Newton and his universal laws. For others (this historian included), the history of science and medicine is a tale of arcane byways strewn with good ideas that never came to much, and bad ideas that were showered with investments of time and money only to meet the same fate. Some historical accounts focus on the places where scientific thinking evolved: artisans’ shops, alchemical laboratories, and anatomical theatres. Some historians zoom in on the ideas themselves and the often-incremental changes that were necessary before scientific theories developed and gained traction. 

These different perspectives make it exciting to be a historian, but it can be bewildering to those wanting to know more about scientific and medical developments. What is true for the history of science and medicine in general seems doubly true for the period known as the Scientific Revolution, the creative, chaotic, and pivotal period in western European science from 1400 to 1700. Even writing that sentence is challenging for me, as I want to immediately begin editing it, qualifying what I said to acknowledge that it was less chaotic than it seems, that it was less “revolutionary” than many historians once made it out to be with plenty of continuity to leaven all that change, and that the seemingly “European” Scientific Revolution was fueled by material and intellectual discoveries all around the world. While most historians are happy to admit **something** happened to the study of nature between 1400 and 1700, we remain strangely unable to describe exactly what that something was. The maddening maze of qualifications and uncertainties that riddle our thinking and our prose like the trails of bookworms led Steven Shapin to famously proclaim in his 1996 book, [_The Scientific Revolution_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/asin/0226750213/ref=nosim/backlist0e-20), “There was no such thing as the Scientific Revolution, and this is a book about it.” 

Here are ten more books about the Scientific Revolution—whatever that is, if indeed there is such a thing. If you read some (or all) of them, they will provide a sense, albeit quirky and partial, of what it meant to be interested in the natural world during the early modern period. There are no introductory texts or vast overviews on it. Instead, there are classic works of intellectual history as well as more recent, challenging interpretations. The subjects range over many scientific and medical disciplines. Whether you prefer an approach to the history of science and medicine that focuses on big ideas, perplexing characters, or hands-on experimentation, there’s something here for you.
