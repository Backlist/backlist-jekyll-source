Historians of the United States have written and argued more about American slavery than about nearly any other subject, at least in part because the connection between racial hierarchy and economic production has always been central to American life. Scholarly interpretations of slavery, however, have changed drastically over the course of the last century. Where historians in the early twentieth century described slavery as an essentially benign institution, historians of the postwar era described it as a cruel and harsh one akin to a prison. By the 1970s, that latter reading gave way to one stressing how slaveholders dulled slave resistance by cultivating ideas about mutual obligations between masters and slaves. But other scholars responded by showing the vitality of the faith, families, and communities of enslaved people, demonstrating how pervasive slave resistance actually was, and pointing out that slaveholders were acquisitive, entrepreneurial, and not nearly so paternalistic as they claimed.

Today, studies at the forefront of slavery scholarship often draw attention to the relationship between American slavery and American capitalism, focus on the significance of gender and sexuality, and ask that we think beyond customary boundaries of time and geography. But those emphases are unlikely to be at the forefront ten or twenty years from now, because even though slavery was outlawed more than 150 years ago, its legacy remains nearly everywhere we look, providing fresh angles of vision on the past not only for historians but for novelists and filmmakers as well.
 
Given the immense bibliography that might be compiled of American slavery studies, this list does not purport to provide even a smattering of what most scholars would consider the most important works on the subject. But collectively, they hint at where the field has been, demonstrate some of its contemporary evolution, and provide room for the voices of both people who experienced enslavement and artists who have imagined it in especially powerful ways.
