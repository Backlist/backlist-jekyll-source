For centuries, travelers from Asia crossed the turbulent waters of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea, and traversed the harsh deserts of the Silk Road. Their journeys as artisans, slaves, merchants, itinerant pilgrims, scholars, and sojourners point to a long, variegated history of Asian mobility. Until recently, however, migration histories have tended to cast these movements as both temporary and “unfree,” and in contrast to the “free” European settlement migrations across the trans-Atlantic world. Why do we call some migrants “sojourners” and others “settlers” or “pioneers?” Under what conditions do we name a community a “diaspora”? 

The labels we attach to migrants are never neutral, but instead are bound up in the politics and historical circumstances of their mobility. In putting this list together, I have chosen to include diverse forms of Asian mobility under the rubric of migration in order to demonstrate how these movements have been historically connected. To highlight the social, cultural, and economic impacts of these migrations in global history, I have selected books that focus on overseas and cross-continental mobility. Unfortunately, this has meant that I have excluded important localized or “internal” migrations, such as the 1947 Partition of India. Moreover, while this list concentrates primarily on the histories of Chinese and South Asian travelers—historically, the two largest migrant communities from the region—the story of Asian mobility is not solely theirs.

Within this robust body of literature, several important themes emerge. First, the historical mode of travel for Asian migrants has predominantly taken a circular or serial route rather than a uni-directional movement from homeland to the host destination. Second, Asian migrations was—and still is—a deeply gendered experience, affecting men, women, and children in significantly different ways. Although the figure of the lone male sojourner is often seen as emblematic of Asian migrations, female migrants were also important historical figures. Furthermore, migrants from China and India often maintained “translocal” connections, weaving together the local economies and cultures of their homelands with their place of residence.

This list merely skims the surface of the rich scholarship on Asian migrations, offering a starting point for curious readers. The books and memoirs here tell many stories—of the mass mobilization of Asian labor for colonial development, the intimate encounters between migrants and immigration laws, the social histories of diasporic communities, and their sense of alienation and negotiated belonging in new, foreign places.
