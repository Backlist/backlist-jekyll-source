description: 'Historians generally agree that museums manifest expressions of colonial scientific enterprises evolving over time. Growing to include millions of objects—including human remains and culturally and spiritually sensitive objects—civic museums in the United States and Europe by the mid-twentieth century had become, for a time, among the most important cultural centers worldwide. This list highlights books exploring how these museums grew to have many of the most important anthropological collections on the planet and how Eurocentric museum practices spread into non-Western places, especially in regions where colonial influence proved strong.'

It’s a dramatic story, really. At virtually the same moment in history Europeans are able to travel and communicate much longer distances—enabling them to collect cultural artifacts like never before—newly emergent cities across the United States and Europe built massive new civic museums. These grand new museums, perhaps predictably, beckoned to be filled with those things collected from around the globe. Appearing in places like Chicago, Amsterdam, New York, Berlin, Philadelphia and even, after some time, places like Jakarta, new museums (and their expanding collections) frequently became a point of pride for cities and their boosters. Museums in the United States and Europe rapidly expanded, competing for the biggest, best, most unique artifacts. Growing to include millions of objects—including human remains, culturally and spiritually sensitive objects, and important genealogical information for indigenous people today—these museums became, for a time, among the most important cultural centers worldwide. This list highlights some of the most important and interesting books exploring how these museums grew to have many of the most important anthropological collections on the planet. It also touches on how Eurocentric museum practices spread into non-Western places, especially in regions where colonial influence proved strong.

As a historian most interested in culture and ideas, I’ve found museums to be an extremely fruitful theme for critical study. Historians generally agree that museums manifest expressions of colonial scientific enterprises evolving over time. While these institutions were, for a time, great engines for intellectual production—rivaling (and indeed, in many cases overshadowing) sleepy colleges and universities—anthropologists, archaeologists, and many other museum-based scientists began to shift their focus to more theoretically-oriented questions. Curators and other museum staff still engaged in extensive fieldwork, but with less emphasis on collecting objects for display. Some important curators left museum jobs for faculty positions at universities, and by the mid-twentieth century, the emphasis in museums began to shift to education, rather than research. Exhibitions became increasingly more important, as did other forms of educational programming. _Collecting_ gave way to _display_. 

I’m not the first historian to recognize the potential for studying the past through studying museums. Far from it. In fact, dozens of historians, anthropologists, and other writers have found museums to be a valuable lens through which we can learn more about intellectual history, cross-cultural interaction, class, race, and nationalism. George W. Stocking was long considered the doyen in the history of anthropology. He wrote and edited numerous books and essays, including landmark collections on the history of anthropology and the social sciences as they developed over the long-nineteenth century. Others continue to build on these and other early studies to create a fascinating body of literature on museum history. This list represents only a small slice of the rich literature on the topic.
