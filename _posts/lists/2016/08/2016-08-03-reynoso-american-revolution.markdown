description: 'For most Americans, the mention of the American Revolution can easily bring to mind a slew of notable figures, events, and even regions, such as Boston and its harbor. In recent decades, historians have done much to move past more familiar understandings of the period, often focusing their studies on obscure individuals or settings, but many of these lesser-known subjects still fall within the boundaries of the thirteen British colonies that secured their independence in 1783. The books in the list move beyond the “thirteen colonies” to provide alternative vantage points that help paint a richer, more regionally complex understanding of the American Revolution.'

It is no secret that the American Revolution has enjoyed a long hold on the American psyche. For most Americans, the mere mention of it can easily bring to mind a slew of notable figures, events, and even regions, such as Boston and its harbor. It is not at all surprising, then, that the Revolutionary Era has also loomed large in the study of American history. In recent decades, however, historians have done much to move past more familiar understandings of the period, often focusing their studies on obscure individuals or settings. Yet, many of these lesser-known figures or locales fall within the boundaries of the thirteen British colonies that secured their independence from Britain in 1783—a set of colonies which most Americans know simply as “the thirteen colonies.”

The trouble is, at the time of the revolution, British America consisted of twenty-six colonies, not thirteen. The imperial connections that cut across their separate boundaries often kept individuals politically, commercially, and even personally tied to events and individuals throughout the empire. And although only thirteen colonies did eventually break away from the British Empire, neither their fate nor their number was ever predetermined. It was also not a struggle that was purely defined through colonial actors in colonial settings. Even as it took place, the American Revolution both shaped and was shaped by occurrences outside of those thirteen colonies. What’s more, the end of the Revolutionary War may have brought the united thirteen colonies new political realities, but it did so for Britain’s other thirteen colonies as well.

Moving past the thirteen colonies or focusing on individuals and organisms that could and did travel through, across, and beyond their boundaries helps us better understand not just what happened elsewhere in British America, but within the united thirteen colonies as well. The books in the list that follows provide alternative vantage points that help paint a richer, more regionally complex understanding of the American Revolution.
