As a Brazilian living in the US, I have seen over the past sixteen years a growing awareness about Brazil. I’ve gone from having to explain that Brazilians don’t speak Spanish, to seeing Brazil constantly on the news, for better or worse – from its economic boom that survived the global depression to the current political instability and the dire warnings surrounding the 2016 Olympics. The fascination perhaps lies on the fact that while the country itself is becoming more familiar, the story of how Brazil came to be remains a mystery to many Americans, let alone everyday Brazilians – a tale of contradictions within contradictions.

For one, Brazil has always touted its history of racial tolerance, devoid of the kind of legally enforced segregation that existed in the United States. On the other hand, it is the country that brought the largest number of African slaves to the Americas, whose slave system was only abolished in 1888, and where racial inequality remains a persistent problem. Brazil’s territory is larger than the continental US, but Brazil’s government has long struggled to maintain control over its own land, especially the Amazon. And while known as a Catholic nation, Brazil is actually a polyreligious society, where devotees of African deities, spiritists, Pentecostal evangelicals and followers of dozens of spiritual cults can be neighbors, or sometimes even participate in multiple belief systems at the same time.

What better way to explain these apparent contradictions than to delve into the history that made Brazil what is? Starting with a few books that will give you the big picture of Brazil’s history, this list goes into deeper histories of popular culture, religion and the environment in Brazil that will help you better understand the complexities of this nation now thrust into the global spotlight.
