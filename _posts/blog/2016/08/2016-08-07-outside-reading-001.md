In this first installment of “Outside Reading,” we’ve collected some reading lists from around the web on subjects from Marvel’s Black Panther reboot to the U.S. Civil War, and if you missed it, last week we had our own list from Jacqueline C. Reynoso on “[The American Revolution in Unexpected Places][amrev]”.

### [Food Anthropology, A Tribute to Sidney W. Mintz][food-anthro]

In tribute to Sidney Mintz, Jason Antrosio collects a list of books and articles suitable for an introduction to food anthropology for [Anthropology Report][anthro-report]. Mintz’s [_Sweetness and Power_][sweetness-power] features as a Place to Start on Rachel Herrmann’s “[Histories of Food and Hunger][food-and-hunger]”.

### [Introduction to the #WakandaSyllabus][wakanda]

Walter Greason has collected books, links, music, and video resulting from his #WakandaSyllabus Twitter experiment for the [African American Intellectual History Society][aaihs]. Together they provide context for the new [_Black Panther_][black-panther] (and upcoming [_World of Wakanda_][world-of-wakanda]) series as “an opportunity for global audiences to study the traditions of black nationalism, Pan-Africanism, and the variety of African indigenous cultures.”


### [Indigenous Book Club Month: Books by Native Authors][indigenous]

June was Indigenous Book Club Month in Canada, and in recognition [Minnesota Public Radio][mpr] arranged for the compilation of this list of books by Native authors and allies.


### [100 Must-Read Books About the Civil War Era][civil-war]

Liberty Hardy collects 100 histories and novels covering not only the time of the U.S. Civil War itself, but the antebellum period and the war’s consequences as well.
