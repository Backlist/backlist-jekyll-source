      A one of a kind document, these are the recordings that Alan Lomax made of Jelly Roll Morton reminiscing, spinning yarns, telling anecdotes, playing piano, and singing in the Library of Congressâ€™s Coolidge auditorium as part of a Works Progress Administration-funded (WPA) cultural project. Not all of it is considered one hundred percent historically accurate, but there is something deeply important and fascinating about _hearing_ Morton recount his life and the early history of jazz over brilliant, corresponding piano performances.
