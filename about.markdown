We’re historians who also happen to be professors, writers, and designers—but first of all, we’re readers. And we’ve created Backlist because we wanted a place to celebrate and recommend a much wider range of historical scholarship than we tend to be able to find at big box bookstores. There is so much wonderful history out there, but it can be hard to know where to start. Backlist is for all readers who are interested in history, and the lists you’ll find here are designed with the general reader (or scholarly non-specialist) in mind.

Backlist is [Christopher Heaney][chtwitter], [Brian Jones][bjtwitter], and [Amy Kohout][aktwitter].
