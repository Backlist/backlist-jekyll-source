# About Backlist

A publisher’s backlist contains the books that never go out of print. Ours is a place for collections of books that historians might put on their own backlists – the books on a particular theme that we return to again and again, the books we recommend and assign, the books that model what it means to join a conversation or to ask a new question. Backlist is like a favorite scholar’s office: filled to overflowing with stacks and piles sorted around big questions and cross-cutting themes, echoing with animated conversation.
